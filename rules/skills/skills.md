Cepheus Engine SRD 14 Samardan Pre ss Difficulty and Effect A check's Difficulty is a number set by the Referee that modifies your check result. When no Difficulty is given, the assumed Difficulty is +0. So, for a task with a Difficulty of +2, you must add +2 to the check result. You succeed on a total of 8 or better. The list of Difficulty ratings can be found in the Task Difficulty table Table: Task Difficulties Difficulty DM Simple +6 Easy +4 Routine +2 Aver age +0 Difficult -2 Very Difficult -4 Formidable -6 In some cases, the consequences of a check vary based on how much the check result is above or below the target of 8. The difference between the check result and the target of 8 is called the Effect. If the Effect is 6 or higher, the check is considered an Exceptional Success. When the Effect is -6 or lower, the check is considered an Exceptional Failure. See Chapter 2: Skills for more detail s. Table: Degrees of Success Effect Range Degree of Success -6 or lower Exceptional Failure -1 to -5 Failure 0 to +5 Success +6 or higher Exceptional Success Opposed Checks If two characters are opposing each other directly in a task, then the character who o btains the highest Effect wins. For ties on oppose d checks, the character with the highest relevant characteristic score wins. If the characters tie on characteristic scores, they reroll. Trying Again In general, you can try a check again if you fail, and keep trying indefinitely. Some tasks, however, ha ve consequences for failure. For example, failing an Athletics check while climbing a cliff might mean you fall, which might make it difficult to try again. Some tasks can't be attempted again once a check has failed. For most tasks, once you've succeeded, additional successes are meaningless. (Once you've discovered a computer account's password using the Computer skill, for instance, there's no further benefit from additional Computer checks to determine the account's password.) Circumstance Modifiers Some circumstances make a check easier or harder, resulting in a bonus or penalty that is added to the check result. The Referee can alter the odds of success in two ways:  If a character has help, such as good tools, competent aids or other beneficial circum stances, he receives a +1 bonus to his skill check.  If a character is hampered, such as having defective tools, incompetent assistance or other negative circumstances, he receives a -1 penalty to his skill check.

Cepheus Engine SRD 15 Samardan Pre ss Time and Checks Outside of stressful situ ations such as combat, performing a particular task often takes a random amount of time, depending on circumstances. For most tasks, roll 1 D6 and multiply it by the increment that the Referee provides for that action. For example, breaking a flimsy wooden door down may only require 1 D6 seconds, while performing delicate surgery might take 1 D6 hours. More information on time increments can be found in Chapter 2: Skills. During combat, most actions are more refined to a finite period. Some of these actions ar e considered minor actions, while others are deemed significant actions. More information is provided in Chapter 5: Personal Combat. Aiding Another Sometimes characters work together and help each other out. In this case, one character (usually the one wi th the highest total of modifiers on the check) is considered the leader of the effort and makes the check normally, while each helper makes the same check. The Effect of a helper's check result can provide either a bonus ( DM+1 with a successful result, DM+2 with an Exceptional Success) or a penalty ( DM-1 with a failed result, DM-2 with an Exceptional Failure) to the leader's check result. In many cases, outside help isn't beneficial, or only a limited number of helpers can aid someone at once. The Referee limits aid as appropriate for the task and conditions. Types of Checks There are two main types of checks: skill checks and characteristic checks. Skill Checks A skill check determines what you can accomplish with a particular skill (sometimes whether you're trained in that skill or not). It is a roll of 2 D6, modified by your levels in the skill, the skill's key characteristic score modifier, and the Difficulty, against a target of 8 or higher. Skill checks sometimes have gradations of success and fail ure based on the Effect of your check result (how much higher or lower your check result is when compared to the target of 8). When making a skill check, if a character does not have any levels in the required skill, then he suffers a –3 penalty for being unskilled. Attack Rolls An attack roll determines whether or not you hit an opponent in combat. An attack roll is essentially a skill check, using your skill levels in combat skills as modifiers. Characteristic Checks A characteristic check is like a ski ll check, but measures raw ability, like strength, endurance, or intelligence. These checks are used when the task is one not covered by an obvious skill, or where the character’s innate abilities are the most important influence on the result. To make a C haracteristic check, you must roll 2 D6 and add the appropriate characteristic score modifier. Characteristic checks tend to be all or nothing (you can either accomplish the task or you can't), although there are sometimes gradations of success or failure.

Cepheus Engine SRD 19 Samardan Pre ss Skill: An ability to perform a set action, such as navigating a starship, operating a rifle, or programming a computer. Skills are attained in l evels (Navigation -1, Computer -2, etc); the higher the level of a skill, the more expertise a character has in that area. Many different individual skills are available to characters. Small Craft: A vessel under 100 tons, capable of interplanetary travel. Sophont: A sentient being with a base reasoning capacity roughly equivalent to or greater than that of an average human being. Spinward: An astrographical term indicating the direction of the galaxy’s rotation. Standard Day: A unit of time that is 24 hours long. Standard Year: A unit of time that is 365 Standard Days in length. Starport: A port where interstellar and interplanetary vessels load or unload, especially one where customs officers are stationed. Starship: A spaceship with a jump drive, capable o f interstellar travel on its own. Target (also subject): The intended recipient of an attack, action, or effect. Trailing: An astrographical term indicating the direction opposite of the galaxy's rotation. Trained: Having knowledge of, and therefore levels in, a skill. Unarmed attack: A melee attack made with no weapon. Universe: The setting presented by a Referee, in which characters play out adventures and campaigns. A Referee may use a published setting for their adventures, or create their own with the Cepheus Engine rules. Untrained: Having no ranks in a skill. Some skills cannot be used untrained. Unskilled skill checks suffer a DM-3 penalty. Vessel: General term used to starships, small craft, or vehicles as a general inclusive group. Most commonly, i t refers to any vehicle or ship capable of interplanetary or interstellar travel. World: A generic term in the Cepheus Engine for a ny inhabit able celestial body or similar location represented by a Universal World Profile.

Cepheus Engine SRD 20 Samardan Pre ss BOOK ONE: CHARACTERS

Cepheus Engine SRD 25 Samardan Pre ss The Explanation The numbers represent the position of a pseudo -hexadecimal notation of an individual’s characteristic scores. These scores are, in order: 1. Strengt h (Str) 2. Dexterity (Dex) 3. Endurance (End) 4. Intelligence (Int) 5. Education (Edu) 6. Social Standing (Soc) 7. Psionic Strength (Psi) For example, if a character has the following characteristic scores: Strength 6, Dexterity 8, Endurance 7, Intelligence 11, Educa tion 9, Social Standing 12 Then the character’s UPP would be 687B9C. If the character later tested for Psionics, and ended up with a Psionic Strength of 4, the UPP would then become 687B9C -4. Universal Character Format The following format is used to rep resent a character’s basic game statistics in the Cepheus Engine rules. [Character Name, with rank and/or noble title, if appropriate ] [Character UPP] Age [Character Age] [Character Careers, with terms listed in parentheses] Cr[Character Funds] [Characte r Skill List, in alphabetical order, with skill level s listed after skill names] [Species Traits, if not human; optional] [Character Equipment, if available; list only significant property] Here is an example of a system -wide human celebrity that has been entertaining his holovid fans for almost two decades with his heroic action movies: Bruce Ayala 786A9A Age 38 Entertainer (5 terms) Cr70,000 Athletics -1, Admin -1, Advocate -1, Bribery -1, Carousing -3, Computer -2, Gambling -0, Grav Vehicle -0, Liaison -2, Linguistics -0, Streetwise -0 High passage (x2) Background Skills Before embarking on your careers, you get a number of background skills equal to 3 + your Education DM (1 to 5, depending on your Education score). Homeworld Skills Growing up on your homeworld gave you skills that depend on the planet’s nature. You can select any skill that matches your homeworld’s planetary description and trade codes. If you came from a planet already established in the Referee’s universe, then consult those sources for the pl anet’s description.

Cepheus Engine SRD 28 Samardan Pre ss suffer a DM–2 to qualification rolls for each previous career you have entere d. Once you leave a career you cannot return to it. The Draft and the Drifter career are exceptions to this rule – you can be Drafted into a career you were previously in but got ejected from, and the Drifter career is always open. Table: The Draft Roll Draft Career 1 Aerospace System Defense (Planetary Air Force) 2 Marine 3 Maritime System Defense (Planetary Navy) 4 Navy 5 Scout 6 Surface System Defense (Planetary Army) Terms of Service Each step through the cycle of resolving your career path, yo u will go through a term of service that lasts approximately four years long. This adds four years to the character’s age. Each time the character reenlists, or enters into a new career, it is for another term, or four additional years of service. Basic T raining On the first term of a new career, you gain Basic Training as you learn the basics for your chosen career. For your first career only, you get all the skills listed in the Service Skills table at Level 0 as your basic training. For any subsequent c areers, you may pick any one skill listed in the Service Skills table at Level 0 as your basic training. Survival Each career has a survival roll. If you fail this roll, your character is dead, and you must create a new one. A natural 2 is always a failur e. Optional Rule: With the Referee’s approval, you can keep the character that fails a survival roll and roll on the Survival Mishaps table instead. This mishap is always enough to force you to leave the service after half a term, or two years of service. You lose the benefit roll for the current term only. Table: Survival Mishaps 1D6 Mishap 1 Injured in action. (This is the same as a result of 2 on the Injury table.) Alternatively, roll twice on the Injury table and take the lower result. 2 Honorably di scharged from the service. 3 Honorably discharged from the service after a long legal battle. Legal issues create a debt of Cr 10,000. 4 Dishonorably discharged from the service. Lose all benefits. 5 Dishonorably discharged from the service after serving an extra 4 years in prison for a crime. Lose all benefits. 6 Medically discharged from the service. Roll on the Injury table. Commission and Advancement Within military careers, a Commission check represents an opportunity to join the ranks of the comm issioned officers. In non -military careers, the Commission check represents an op portunity to gain a position within the hierarchy common to your chosen career. Some careers do not have an established hierarchy, as such, and so do not offer Commission chec ks. A character that succeeds at a Commission roll becomes a Rank 1 officer in that career, and uses the officer Rank table from then on. In addition, you gain an extra roll on any of the Skills and

Cepheus Engine SRD 44 Samardan Pre ss  Great Leaper: Members of this species can jump great distances. As a significant action, a member of this species may make an Athletics skill check. If successful, it jumps four squares, plus a number of squares equal to the Effect of the skill check. In addition, members of this species are treat ed as having the Athletics skill at level 0.  Heat Endurance: Members of this species do not suffer hourly damage from the effects of hot weather and exposure.  Heavy Gravity Adaptation: Members of this species evolved on a world with a higher gravity and do not have to acclimatize to high -gravity environments.  Hive Mentality: Members of this species are driven by a hive mentality, and often pursue actions that support the greater good of their current identified family group, even at the risk of their own pe rsonal safety. Characters must make an Intelligence check to avoid risking their own safety when doing so would help their family group. The difficulty of the Intelligence check varies based on the degree of perceived benefit to the family group (this is u sually an Average task (DM+0), although circumstances can arise where the difficulty ranges from Routine (DM+2) to Difficult (DM –2).)  Large: The species is considerably larger than the average for sophonts. Large creatures generally have a Strength and End urance of 3d6 or even 4d6, and a Dexterity of 1d6. Life support requirements for Large creatures are doubled. Some Large creatures are described as Huge. Attacks against Huge creatures receive a +1 DM to hit.  Low Gravity Adaptation: Members of this species evolved on a world with a lower gravity and do not have to acclimatize to low -gravity environments.  Low -Light Vision: Members of this species can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.  Natural Pilot: Members of this species have an innate understanding of multi -dimensional space, and so receive a DM+2 to their Pilot ing and Navigation checks.  Natural Swimmer: Members of this species are natural swimmers and gain a +2 DM on all skill checks related to swimming.  Natural Weapon: The species has a natural weapon, such as claws, a strong bite or a poisonous stinger. Such weapons are usable at Personal range and dea l +1 damage. The creature gains Natural Weapons at level 0.  Naturally Curious: Members of this species are driven by a natural sense of curiosity, and are easily dragged into any adventure. They have to check out everything and always want to know what’s b ehind a potential mystery. Characters must make an Intelligence check to avoid acting on their curious impulses. The difficulty of the Intelligence check varies based on the degree of perceived mystery (this is usually an Average task (DM+0), although circ umstances can arise where the difficulty ranges from Routine (DM+2) to Difficult (DM – 2).)  No Fine Manipulators: The species has no fingers or other prehensile appendages, preventing them from easily picking things up, pushing small buttons, reaching into t ight spaces, and so on.  Notable (Characteristic): Some species are notably dexterous, intelligent, tough or strong. Characters from such races have a positive Dice Modifier when rolling for that characteristic (+2 unless otherwise specified), and their rac ial maximum for that characteristic is increased by the same amount.  Psionic: All members of the species are Psionic, and may determine their Psionic Strength and talents at the start of character generation.  Small: Small species generally have a Strengt h and Endurance of only 1 D6, and a Dexterity of 3 D6. The minimum size for a sophont is about half that of a human.  Slow Metabolism: Creatures with a slow metabolism require less food than most species, and their life support costs are halved. In combat, sl ow-metabolism creatures suffer a –2 initiative penalty.

Cepheus Engine SRD 49 Samardan Pre ss Skill Descriptions This section describes each skill found in the Cepheus Engine, including its common uses. You may be able to use skills for tasks other than those given here. The Referee sets the D ifficulty and decides the results in all cases. Admin The character has experience with bureaucratic agencies, and understands the requirements of dealing with and managing them. When attempting tasks like avoiding police harassment, ensuring the prompt issuance of licenses, approval of applications, avoidance of close inspection of papers, etc., a successful Admin skill check (with a Difficulty based on Base Difficulty by Law Level table ), will provide a positive outcome to the situation. Bureaucrats and Administrators: Dealing with administrators and bureaucrats is always a time consuming and tedious chore, which somehow seems to play a common part in Cepheus Engine adventures. No special skills are needed to deal with bureaucrats, but characters with th e Admin (or Advocate) skill will be familiar with their ways and find the task much smoother and easier. The offer of a bribe and a Bribery skill check may also be attempted in place of an ability or Admin or Advocate skill check. See the Bribery skill des cription for more information. Advocate The character is familiar with the general laws and regulations that govern interstellar travel, commerce and relations. This skill does not impart knowledge of the myriad of laws on each individual world, nor does it allow the person to act as an attorney. Ship Inspections: Typically, when a ship arrives at a new world, it will be inspected by the port authorities to check for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. It is also not uncommon for patrol sh ips to stop and board merchant and other ships while in deep space. When such an inspection does occur, the character may make a n Advocate check (with a Difficulty based on Base Difficulty by Law Level table) to be found in compliance and pass inspection. If there is anything illegal on board, the character suffers a -2 DM to the check. Aircraft (Cascade Skill) The various specialties of this skill cover different types of flying vehicles. When this skill is received, the character must immediately select one of the following: Grav Vehicle, Rotor Aircraft or Winged Aircraft. Animals (Cascade Skill) The various specialties of this skill cover different aspects of animal handling. When this skill is received, the character must immediately select one of the following: Farming, Riding, Survival, or Veterinary Medicine. Archery The character is skilled at using bows and crossbows for hunting or in combat. Athletics This skill covers physical fitness and training, similar to that of a trained athlete. This inc ludes acts requiring physical coordination, such as climbing, juggling or throwing; acts of endurance, such as long -distance running or hiking; and acts of strength, such as weight -lifting or bodybuilding. Aliens with Wings: For alien species with wings, t his skill is also used to reflect their ability to fly. Battle Dress This skill permits the character to operate advanced battle armor, a powered form of combat armor that enhances the wearer's capabilities in various ways. Ground -based military forces, a nd numerous mercenaries, are often trained in the basics of battle dress operation. This skill also covers the ability to operate vehicles designed as mechanical exoskeletons.

A character may attempt to cheat during a game at any time by stating his or her intent to cheat and making an extra Gambling check. If any other player in the game makes a successful opposing Gambling check against the character's attempt at cheating they are caught red - handed. Otherwise the player has successfully cheated and takes the pot. If more than one person attempts to cheat during the same round of play, the perso n with the highest roll wins the pot. Grav Vehicle This skill grants the ability to properly maneuver and perform basic, routine maintenance on air/rafts and other vehicles that use gravitic technology. Grav vehicles have theoretically perfect maneuverabi lity and can hover, but skill checks may be necessary when performing high -speed aerobatics. Gravitics The character is practiced in installing, maintaining, repairing and/or creating gravitic devices and equipment. Such items include air/raft lift module s, grav belts, grav sleds, grav tanks, etc. Gravitics skill deals with the technical details of such vehicles; Grav Vehicle skill is required to actually pilot or drive them. The character can practice a trade and make a decent living, earning a paycheck f or every week of dedicated work. The character knows how to use the tools of the trade, how to perform routine tasks, how to supervise untrained helpers, and how to handle common problems. Gun Combat (Cascade Skill) The various specialties of this skill c over different types of ranged personal weapons. When this skill is received, the character must immediately select one of the following: Archery, Energy Pistol, Energy Rifle, S hotgun, Slug Pistol, or Slug Rifle. Gunnery (Cascade Skill) The various specia lties of this skill cover different types of devastating weapons commonly used against vehicles, spaceships and ground installations. When this skill is received, the character must immediately select one of the following: Bay Weapons, Heavy Weapons, Scree ns, Spinal Mounts, or Turret Weapon s. Heavy Weapons The Heavy Weapons skill covers man -portable and larger weapons that cause extreme property damage, such as rocket launchers, artillery and plasma weapons. Jack -of-All-Trades (Jack o' Trades or JoT ) The Jack of All Trades skill works differently to other skills. It reduces the unskilled penalty a character receives for not having the appropriate skill by one for every level of Jack of All Trades. Jack of All Trades cannot grant a skill bonus at higher lev els.

Cepheus Engine SRD 55 Samardan Pre ss Riding This skill grants the ability to properly maneuver and provide basic, routine care for horse s and other living creatures that are trained to bear a rider. Rotor Aircraft This skill grants the ability to properly maneuver and perform basic, routine maintenance on helicopters, hovercraft and other similar craft. Rotor aircraft can hover but may re quire skill checks to keep steady in the face of adverse environmental conditions. Sciences (Cascade Skill) The various specialties of this skill cover different types of planetary transportation. When this skill is received, the character must immediatel y select one of the following: Life Sciences, Physical Sciences, Social Sciences, or Space Sciences. Sailing Ships This skill grants the ability to properly maneuver and perform basic, routine maintenance on wind -driven watercraft. Screens The character is skilled at activating and using a ship’s energy screens like nuclear dampers or meson screens. Shotgun The character is skilled at using shotguns. Slashing Weapons The character is skilled at using cutting and slashing weapons, such as swords and axe s, in personal combat. Slug Pistol The character is skilled at using projectile -based pistols like the body pistol or snub pistol. Slug Rifle The character is skilled at using projectile -based rifle weapons such as the autorifle or gauss rifle. Social Sciences This skill represents theoretical and practical knowledge derived from the scientific study of sophont society and social relationships. This covers a wide range of related fields, such as archeology, economics, history, philosophy, psychology and sophontology. Space Sciences This skill represents theoretical and practical knowledge derived from several scientific disciplines that study phenomena occurring in interplanetary and interstellar space, and the celestial bodies that exist within that space. This covers a wide range of related fields, such as astronomy, cosmology, planetology and xenology. Spinal Mounts The character is skilled at operating bay or spinal mount weapons on board a ship. These weapons can be used against other ships or for planetary bombardment or attacks on stationary targets. Steward

Cepheus Engine SRD 57 Samardan Pre ss Wheeled Vehicle This skill grants the ability to properly maneuver and perform basic, routine maintenance on automobiles and similar wheeled vehicles. Winged Aircraft This skill grants the ability to properly maneuver and perform basic, routine maintenance on jets and other airplanes using a lifting body. Winged aircraft must keep moving forwards or they will stall and fall out of the sky. Zero -G The character is acclimated to working and living in micro -gravi ty environments and freefall. The character is trained and familiar with the use of weapons and combat in such environments. In addition, the individual has been trained in the wearing, care, and maintenance of all types of Vacuum Suits and Combat Armor co mmonly used in these conditions. Gaining New Skill Levels during Game Play A character’s Skill Total is calculated by summing the levels of each skill (level zero skills count as zero). A character with Mechanics 1 and Slug Pistol 2 would have a Skill Tot al of 3. To increase a skill, a character must train for a number of weeks equal to his current Skill Total plus the desired level of the skill. So, to advance from Piloting 2 to Piloting 3 with a current Skill Total of 3 would take (three, plus three) si x weeks. A character may only train one skill in a given week. The Jack of all Trades skill cannot be learned.

Cepheus Engine SRD 58 Samardan Pre ss CHAPTER 3: PSIONICS For characters in Cepheus Engine campaigns, psionics covers a broad category of mental disciplines and paranormal abilitie s originating from the mind. Psionics are divided into five different categories, call ed talents. These talents are: Awareness, Clairvoyance, Telekinesis, Telepathy, and Teleportation. The contents of this Chapter are optional. It is up to the individual R eferee if psionics is even available, much less how a character may acquire these talents. Psionic Strength Psionics are powered by the Psionic Strength characteristic (abbreviation Psi). This characteristic cannot be rolled or bought during character cre ation without the Referee's permission. To determine a character's Psionic Strength, roll 2 D6 and subtract the number of terms served by the character in any career (Psionic Strength diminishes over time unless actively used). Using a psionic talent costs a number of Psionic Strength points, temporarily reducing the character's total. As the Characteristic DM for all Psionic skill checks is determined by the characters' current Psionic Strength total, it gets harder and harder to use powers as the characte r's strength declines. Recovering Psionic Strength Points Expended Psionic Strength points are recovered at the rate of one point per hour, beginning three hours after the character last used a psionic talent. Psionic Training The first step is testing a character's Psionic Strength, which is determined as described above (2 D6 – number of terms served). If the character still has any Psionic Strength remaining, he can be trained. Training requires four months of work, and costs Cr100,000. As part of tra ining, the character may attempt to learn any of the common psionic talents on the Psionic Training table by making a Psionic Strength check. He may attempt the talents in any order, but suffers a –1 DM per check attempted. If a character learns a talent, he gains that talent at level 0. Table: Learning DMs by Talent Talent Learning DM Awareness +1 Clairvoyance +3 Telekinesis +2 Telepathy +4 Teleportation +0 Per previous talent acquisition check –1 Psionic Talents There are several psionic talents, each of which works like a skill for the powers in question. A character trained in the use of psionics may develop his talents over time just as if they were normal skills. Unlike other skills, psionic talents cannot be used untrained. The most common ta lents are:  Awareness – control over one's own mind and body.  Clairvoyance – perceiving at a distance.  Telekinesis – mind over matter.  Telepathy – reading minds and mental communication.  Teleportation – moving from one point to another instantly.

Cepheus Engine SRD 65 Samardan Pre ss angry mobs often go on witch hunts, looking for psions and generally lynching, lobotomizing, imprisoning or exiling the offenders. Individuals may even be informants or potential informants, ready to call the local authorities a t the slightest hint of psionic abilities in use. Governments in psi -hostile societies will publicly denounce the use of psionics, but it is likely that they might maintain a secre t training facility due to the usefulness of such powers in espionage and warfare. In a Psi -Hostile society, even having sympathy for the plight of psionic people can cause an individual to be ostracized. This type of society is the most commonly encounter ed in Cepheus Engine campaigns, because the world it creates is closest to the “real world” experiences shared by most Cepheus Engine players, and the rules tend to operate as if this were the standard. Psi-Neutral Societies In Psi -Neutral societies, psio nics does not have the stigma that they do in Psi -Hostile societies. The general populace recognizes the existence of psions, and considers it just another set of talents one can possess, much like athletic prowess or superior marksmanship. The use of psio nics is fairly regulated by law level, as the public is aware that psionics have great potential for abuse, but such a culture generally holds a stronger view of personal responsibility and punishes abusers accordingly. Training in such a culture is easier to come by, but is treated much like a vocational school, in that only those who can pay for it are tested and trained. Psionic technology is more likely to be available in such a society, at the discretion of the Referee. Telepaths figure prominently in major corporate and government negotiations. Teleporters are used for quick and sometimes clandestine courier work. Corporate and foreign espionage require another layer of security to address psionic abilities. The accepted use of psionics in such a cultu re can cause some dramatic changes. Psi-Friendly Societies In Psi -Friendly societies, psions are revered and psionic abilities are often considered a mark of the socially elite. It is likely that children are tested at various points during their childhoo d, and those with potential are taught to use their gifts from a very young age. Psionics are integrated at every level of society, and may even lead to a highly structured or caste -like culture where the upper classes are comprised of psionically -gifted i ndividuals. These classes may be further stratified based on an individual’s psionic strength and/or mastery of psionic skills. Non -psions may even be persecuted as second -class citizens without voting or personal rights, in extreme cases. The actual cultu re of such a society, like anything else, is ultimately up to the Referee to determine and present.

Agility (A gi): How easy the vehicle is to drive, expressed as a DM to the pilot’s skill check. Speed (Spd): The vehicle’s maximum speed. Crew and Passengers (C&P): How many people the vehicle can carry. Open/Closed (O/C): If the vehicle is open or closed. Armor: How much armor the vehicle has. Damage sustained by a vehicle is reduced by its armor. Hull: The number of hits the vehicle can sustain to its Hull before being disabled. Structure (Struc): The number of hits the vehicle can sustain to its Structure before being destroyed. Weapons (Wp ns): What weapons the vehicle has, if any, and what fire arcs they are in. Cost: How much the vehicle costs.

Cepheus Engine SRD 91 Samardan Pre ss Drawing and Reloading The time taken to draw a weapon depends on its size and ease of use. The number of minor actions to ready or reload a weapon is listed in the description of each weapon. Most weapons take one minor action to draw and another minor action to reload, but some weapons are especially fast or slow. Movement The character moves up to six meters. When using a square grid for modelling the combat, each square should measure 1.5 meters to the side. This means that the average character moves four squares on his turn. Difficult terrain, such as rubble, mud or thick under -brush can halve a character's movement, allowing him to move only three meters per movement action. Cr ouching also halves movement. Miscellaneous The Referee may permit a character to perform a skill check or other action as a minor action if the use of the skill does not require the character's full attention or complex physical actions. Significant Actions Significant actions are intended to do something within about 3 seconds. You can perform a single significant action per round, or forego it to perform a total of three minor actions. Minor Actions A character can take two minor actions instead o f a significant action. Miscellaneous A character may make a skill check or do something else as a significant action when such an action requires the character's full attention, concentration, complicated physical actions or some combination thereof. Any skill check with a time interval of 1 -6 seconds is simply considered a significant action during combat. Attack The most common significant action is an attack. The basic attack action is trying to injure a foe with a melee attack or a ranged weapon. The attacker declares his target, and the foe may choose to react. The attacker then makes a skill check, and if successful, deals damage to his target. The actual Difficulty of this skill check is determined using the weapon type and the range of the att ack, as given earlier in this chapter under Range. The standard skill checks used in making an attack are:  Melee Attack = 2D6 + appropriate melee combat skill + Strength or Dexterity DM (attacker's choice)  Shooting Attack = 2D6 + appropriate gun combat skill + Dexterity DM  Thrown Attack = 2D6 + Athletics + Dexterity DM

Cepheus Engine SRD 92 Samardan Pre ss Table: Common Modifiers to Attacks in Personal Combat Action Modifier Aiming +1 per Aim action Cover –0 to –6 Environmental Effects –1 to –2 Intelligent Weapon +1 if total DM i s within the program's tolerance Laser Sight +1 if aiming Movement –1 for every 10 full meters of target movement Target Dodges (Reaction) –1 Target Parries (Reaction) –Defender's appropriate melee skill Target Stance –2 if attacking a prone targe t at Medium or greater range +2 if attacking a prone target at Personal range Weapons with Recoil (in Zero Gravity) –2 Coup de Grace A character can use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grace to a helpless opponent that is within close range. They can also use a ranged weapon to do so, provided they are adjacent to the target. The attack automatically hit and the opponent dies. Reactions Reactions are actions taken immediately in response to the action of another. The more time a character spen ds reacting, the longer it will be until he acts himself. Each reaction lowers Initiative by 2 and applies a –1 DM to all skill checks until the following round. There is no limit to how many times a character can react in a round but a character can only react once to each attack and the penalties from reacting are cumulative. A character can only react to attacks that he is aware of. Dodging A character who is being attacked may dodge, giving his attacker a –1 DM and giving himself a –1 DM on all skill checks until the next round. If the character is in cover or has an obstruction to duck or dodge behind, the DM to hit him is increased to –2. Parrying A character who is being attacked in melee can parry, applying his Melee skill as a negative DM equa l to the attack roll. A parrying character also has a –1 DM on all skill checks until the next round. Other Actions Other types of action can take place during personal combat. Free Actions Some actions are so fast they do not even qualify as a minor a ction – shouting a warning, pushing a button, checking your watch, and so on. A character can perform as many of these free actions as he likes in a turn, although if he performs several the Referee may require him to spend a minor or even a significant ac tion on his various tasks. Extended Actions Some skill checks will take longer than a single combat round to complete. Make a Timing roll for the task and then work out how many six second combat rounds it will take to complete. A character engaging in an

Cepheus Engine SRD 95 Samardan Pre ss Explosions Grenades, rockets a nd other explosives affect an area. A character caught in an explosion may dodge at the usual Initiative cost. A character that dodges an explosion may reduce the damage by 1 D6 if he just dodges or by half if he dives for cover. A character that dives for cover ends up prone and loses his next significant action. Extreme Range Firing Any weapon that has the ability to fire into the Distant range b and (including ranged(Rifle), ranged(Assault Weapon) and ranged(Rocket) attacks) can potentially strike targets even beyond, so long as the firer can see the target. Weapons fired at this extreme range do so using the modifiers for Distant range with an ad ditional DM of –2. Only characters with at least three levels of skill in the weapon may fire at extreme range. To fire at extreme range, characters must be stationary and prepared to fire from some kind of rest (tripod, tree limb, bunker embrasure and so on). Vehicles must be stationary for weapons to be fired at extreme range from it. Energy - based weapons (lasers, PGMPs, and so on) inflict half damage (round up) at this extreme range. This can be combined with Aiming for the Kill (above). Fighting in Zero Gravity When fighting in zero gravity, a character's skill levels are limited to lower of the character's Zero -G skill and the appropriate combat skill. For example, if a characte r has Laser Pistol -2 and Zero -G-1, then the character shoots with an effective skill level of 1, since his Zero -G skill level is lower than his Laser Pistol skill level. Characters without Zero -G skill are treated as unskilled in their attack, because of t he disorientation. In addition, characters using weapons with recoil suffer a DM -2 on attack rolls when fighting in zero gravity conditions. Firing into Combat If a character is firing a weapon at a target that is at Personal range to another combatant, then the attack suffers a –2 DM. If the attack misses, roll 1 D6. On a 4+, the attack hits the nearest other combatant to the original target. Grappling A character can attempt to wrestle or grab another person instead of hitting him. The attacker mus t move to Personal range and beat his target in an opposed Natural Weapons skill check. If he wins, he may do any one of the following: • Continue the grapple with no other effects. • Disarm his opponent. If he succeeds by 6+ he can take the weapon away; oth erwise it ends up on the floor. • Drag his opponent up to three meters. • Escape the grapple and move away (as if with a normal movement action). • Inflict damage equal to 2 + the Effect. • Knock his opponent prone. • Throw his opponent up to three meters for 1 D6 damage. Throwing an opponent always ends the grapple. With any other option the winner can choose to end or continue the grapple as he sees fit. A character in a grapple cannot move nor do anything other than make opposed Natural Weapons skill checks. Each time an opposed check is made the winner can choose an option from the above list. Panic Fire In order to call upon Panic Fire, a character must be using some form of small arms slug thrower. Panic fire uses all remaini ng rounds in the weapon, and hits are resolved as if the weapon were being fired using the Burst Fire rules for damage (not for accuracy). There is a DM –2 penalty to hit.

Cepheus Engine SRD 96 Samardan Pre ss Shotgun Spread Any shotgun loaded specifically with f lechette rounds can be fired like a common round at a single target up to Short range, using the standard statistics for the weapon. If firing at a target or group of targets at Medium or Long range, the frag shell has its damage reduced to 2d6 but gains a DM+1 bonus to hit, and can hit not only the target aimed at but also anyone (friend or foe) in Personal range with the initial target. Suppression Fire Suppression fire works by having the character actually target the areas surrounding the target; a wa ll, a tree or even the ground at their feet are all perfectly suitable. The impact of the character’s attacks are often enough to give pause to a potential attacker. The firing character rolls his shooting attack as normal, except with a –2 DM for trying t o hit cover and nearby objects to the target(s). This attack action also uses up double the normal amount of ammunition per attack. Failures are treated as normal misses. Success means that the firer has hit close enough to the target to force them to duck away, stalling their next action by adding an initiative penalty equal to the Effect of the attack. Suppressed targets also receive a DM -1 penalty to any skill checks that they try to perform in both the current and following combat round. Automatic fire can be used for Suppression fire, but no target can be affected twice by Suppression fire on the same action. The target must be allowed to take one action before he can be suppressed again. If multiple hits are used upon the same target, the highest Effec t takes precedence. There are some situations and instances that can make a target so unshakeable that they do not care about Suppression fire, and will not be harried by it. Some of those exceptions are found on the list below. • Vehicles, or targets full y enclosed in vehicles • Zealots • Mechanical or android targets • Targets wearing full Battle Dress • Suicidal targets Stance A character can be standing, crouched or prone. Standing: A standing character uses the normal rules. Crouching: A crouching character moves at half speed bu t can make better use of cover. If a crouching character is in cover, consider it one row lower on the Cover Modifiers table. For example, if a character is crouching behind a waist -high wall, he is considered to be at 3/4 cover rather than 1/2 cover. Pron e: A prone character cannot make melee attacks or dodge. He may make improved use of cover like a crouching character and he may still parry melee attacks. All ranged attacks targeting him suffer a –2 DM penalty. At Close range, the penalty is reduced to + 0; a prone character being attacked at Personal range grants a +2 DM to attacks against him. Tactics and Leadership The Tactics skill can be used to give an Initiative bonus to a whole unit at the start of combat. The unit commander may make a Tactics c heck, and everyone in the unit may increase their Initiative by the Effect of the check. The Leadership skill can be used to increase another character's Initiative. The character with Leadership makes a Leadership check, and the target character's Initia tive is increased by the Effect of the check. Making a Leadership skill check is a significant action.

Cepheus Engine SRD 101 Samardan Pre ss Structure Reduce the vehicle or drone's Structure by one. If a vehicle runs out of Structure, it is destroyed. If the vehicle is destroyed by an attack that reduces it to a negative Structure score it explodes, doing 4 D6 damage to everyone within six meters (including the occupants) and 2 D6 damage to everyone within twelve meters. The occupants of a closed vehicle cannot dodge or dive for cover from this explosion but the oc cupants of an open vehicle can. Armor Reduce the vehicle's armor by one. Drive First Hit: Reduce movement by 10% and apply a –1 DM to all vehicle control skill checks. Second Hit: Reduce movement by 25% and apply a –2 DM to all vehicle control s kill checks. Third Hit: Drive disabled. Further drive hits count as Hull hits. Weapon Choose a weapon or device randomly for each hit. First Hit: The weapon or device suffers a –2 DM to all checks related to its operation. Second Hit: The weapon or device is destroyed. If no weapons remain to be destroyed, further hits on this location become Hull hits. Sensors First Hit: The vehicle or drone suffers a –2 DM to all Comms checks to use sensors. For drones and robots, this also applies to Recon che cks. Second Hit: The sensors are destroyed, blinding the vehicle or drone. Further Sensor hits count as Hull hits. Power Plant First Hit: The vehicle or drone loses one round's worth of actions. Second Hit: The vehicle or drone's movement is reduce d by 50%. Third Hit: The power plant is destroyed, disabling the vehicle and inflicting 1 D6 Hull hits on it. Limb Choose a limb randomly for each limb hit. First Hit: The limb suffers a –2 DM to all checks related to its operation. Second Hit: The li mb is destroyed. Further Limb hits count as Hull hits. Passengers Choose a passenger randomly for any passenger hit. The passenger takes damage equal to the damage inflicted on the vehicle. If all the passengers are dead, further passenger hits become Structure hits. Cargo Any cargo present is hit and may be destroyed. If no cargo remains, further cargo hits become Structure hits. Cockpit The pilot of the vehicle is hit, and takes damage equal to the damage inflicted on the vehicle. If the pilot i s dead, further pilot hits become Structure hits.

Cepheus Engine SRD 128 Samardan Pre ss combat drug packs, combat armor and communications equipment. A general armory for a spacecraft costs MCr0.5 and takes up 2 tons of space. Where military vessels are concerned, the number of armories built into the ship’s design is based on crew size. One armory is instal led for either every 50 crew members, or every 10 marines, in order to provide adequate storage for equipment, weapons and ammunition. Briefing Room A specialized briefing room is useful on mercenary cruisers and other adventuring ships, where teams can discuss plans or meet with clients privately. A briefing room gives a +1 DM to Tactics checks made when planning missions on board ship. Ships with command bridges and fighter squadrons require additional briefing rooms and facilities. Capital ships must th erefore have one briefing room per ship section, and one briefing room for every 20 fighter or bomber crew. Cargo Hold The design plan must indicate cargo capacity. There is no cost but cargo carried may not exceed cargo capacity. Any space left over afte r all systems have been installed may be allocated to cargo space. Detention Cells Found primarily on military and government vessels, a detention cell is used to keep prisoners. A detention cell displaces 2 tons and costs MCr0.25. Fuel Scoops Fuel scoop s allow an unstreamlined ship to gather unrefined fuel from a gas giant. Streamlined ships have fuel scoops built in. Adding scoops costs MCr1 and requires no tonnage. Fuel Processors Fuel processors convert unrefined fuel into refined fuel. One ton of fu el processors can convert 20 tons of unrefined hydrogen into refined fuel per day. A ton of fue l processing equipment costs Cr 50,000. Laboratory Space allocated to laboratories can be used for research and experimentation. Each four tons of lab space allo ws for one scientist to perform research on board ship. The cost for research equipment varies depending on the type of research undertak en, but is generally around MCr 1.0 per 4 tons. Launch Tubes Launching and recovering small craft from a larger vesse l is usually an activity taking 30 minutes to launch or recovery one craft. Launch tubes allow small craft to be launched and recovered rapidly from a ship. The size of a launch tube is twenty –five times the tonnage of the largest craft that will be deploy ed in this manner, and they cost MCr 0.5 per t on. With a launch tube, up to ten small craft can be launched per round. Multiple launch tubes can be installed. Library A library room contains computer files as well as lecterns, display screens, holotanks a nd even hard copies of books. A good library is useful for both research and passing time in jump space. Having a library on board a ship gives one extra week of training time for new skills per week spent in jump space. A library for a spacecraft costs MCr4 and takes up 4 tons of space.

Cepheus Engine SRD 156 Samardan Pre ss Other Actions Other types of action can take place during space combat. Free Actions Some a ctions are so fast on the scale of space combat that they do not even qualify as a minor action. A character can perform as many of these free actions as he likes in a turn, although if he performs several the Referee may require him to spend a minor or ev en a significant action on his various tasks. Extended Actions Some skill checks will take longer than a single combat turn to complete. Make a Timing roll for the task and then work out how many six minute combat turns it will take to complete. A chara cter engaging in an extended action cannot do anything else but can abandon their action at any time and return to the normal Initiative order. A character who is hit by an attack while undertaking an extended action must make an 8+ roll using the skill in question with a negative DM equal to the amount of damage the attack causes (after armor). Failure indicates that this turn's work does not count towards the completion of the task. Failure by six or more (an Exceptional Failure) ruins the task and the ch aracter must start again. Delay A vessel does not have to act when its turn comes up in the Initiative order. The Captain may decide to act at any later point during the turn, even interrupting another's actions to do so. When he acts, his Initiative is set to the count on which he acted. If the character has not acted by the end of the turn he may choose to act first in the next turn, effectively giving up his actions in the previous turn in exchange for an Initiative advantage. His new Initiative is se t to one higher than that of the current first person in the order. When multiple characters are delaying and all wish to act first in the following turn, their Initiatives are all set to the same score and they act in order of Thrust as normal. Special Considerations The following are special considerations in space combat. Abstract Boarding Rules In circumstances when the Referee may wish to resolve a boarding action without resorting to the personal combat rules, the following alternative method is s uggested. On each round of a boarding action, the attacking Chief Security Officer (or Captain, if the CSO is down or not appointed) makes an opposed Intelligence -based Tactics skill check against the Chief Security Officer (or Captain, if the CSO is down or not appointed) of the defenders. The results of each round depend on who wins and the degree of success achieved by the winner of the opposed check, as outlined in the Abstract Boarding Resolution table.

Cepheus Engine SRD 166 Samardan Pre ss Starvation and Dehydration Characters might find themselves without food or water and with no means to obtain them. In normal climates, a character needs at least a gallon of fluids and about a pound of food per day to avoid starvation. In very hot climates, characters need two or three times as much wat er to avoid dehydration. A character can go without water for a number of hours equal to 20 plus twice his Endurance score. After this time, the character must make a Routine (+2) Endurance check each hour (DM -1 for each previous check) or take 1 D6 damage. A character can go without food for 3 days, in growing discomfort. After this time, the character must make a Routine (+2) Endurance check each day (DM -1 for each previous check) or take 1 D6 damage. Damage from thirst or starvation cannot be recovered u ntil the character gets food or water. Suffocation In an area where sufficient oxygen is not long available, such as on board a starship without life support, a character begins to suffocate, suffering 1 D6 damage each minute. A character who is utterly wi thout air (such as one who is being smothered or strangled, or who has been dumped out an airlock) suffers 1 D6 damage each round instead. Vacuum Exposure Beings exposed to the airless cold of space are not immediately doomed. Contrary to popular belief, c haracters exposed to vacuum do not immediately freeze or explode, and their blood does not boil in their veins. While space is very cold, heat does not transfer away from a body that quickly. The real danger comes from suffocation and ionizing radiation. On the third round of exposure to vacuum, a character must succeed on a Very Difficult ( -4) Endurance check each round or suffer from aeroembolism ("the bends"). A character that fails the check experiences excruciating pain as small air bubbles form in its bloodstream; such a character is considered stunned and generally unable to move, and remains so until returned to normal atmospheric pressure. A character that fails the check with an Exceptional Failure (Effect -6 or lower) falls unconscious. The real d anger of vacuum comes from suffocation, though holding one's breath in vacuum damages the lungs. Treat anyone trapped in a hard vacuum as being utterly without air under the Suffocation rules. Unfiltered radiation bombards any character trapped in the vacu um of space without protective gear. A character exposed to this ionizing radiation suffers from severe sunburn as well as the effects equivalent to a high level irradiated area. See Radiation Exposure for specific details. Weather Driving wind, rain, sno wstorms and so forth give a –1 DM to ranged attacks from poor visibility and a –1 DM to ranged attacks from environmental interference. Sensors can be used to avoid the visibility penalty. Extremely high winds and torrential rain can inflict a negative Dic e Modifier of –1 to –4 to all skill checks.

Cepheus Engine SRD 168 Samardan Pre ss World Size The Size characteristic for inhabitable worlds ranges from 0 to 10, and is determined by rolling 2 D6–2.

Common features include improbable -looking rock formations, thin and spindly life forms and flying as a common form of locomotion (assuming the atmosphere is thick enoug h to support flyers). Humans tend to find life on low -gravity worlds to be initially pleasant, but regular exercise regimes and medicinal supplements are required to prevent bone and muscle degradation. Those who spent too long on low -gravity worlds cannot tolerate higher gravities. Characters on low-gravity worlds suffer a –1 DM to all skill checks until they acclimatize, a process which takes 1 D6 weeks. Characters with the Zero -G skill at level 0 or better acclimatize instantly. High -gravity worlds have a gravity 1.25 times or more than of Earth. They tend to be extremely dense worlds; common features include wide rocky plains, squat, muscular creatures, and plant life that spreads out like lichen instead of growing up. Crawling, burrowing or swimming are the commonest forms of locomotion. Humans find high -gravity worlds unpleasant. Especially high -gravity worlds require the use of pressured or powered suits to support the human frame. Characters on high -gravity worlds suffer a –1 DM to all skill checks unt il they acclimatize, a process which takes 1 D6 weeks. Atmosphere A planet’s Atmosphere is generated by rolling 2 D6–7 and adding the planet’s Size. If a world's Size equals 0, then the world's Atmosphere equals 0. The Atmosphere code should never be highe r than 15(F).

A character who bre athes a tainted atmosphere without a filter will suffer 1 D6 damage every few minutes (or hours, depending on the level of taint). Exotic: An exotic atmosphere is unbreathable by humans, but is not otherwise hazardous. A character needs an air supply to br eath in an exotic atmosphere. Corrosive: Corrosive atmospheres are highly dangerous. A character who breathes in a corrosive atmosphere will suffer 1 D6 damage each round. Insidious: An insidious atmosphere is like a corrosive one, but it is so corrosive that it attacks equipment as well. The chief danger in an insidious atmosphere is that the toxic gases will destroy the seals and filters on the character’s protective gear. An insidious atmosphere worms its way past protection after 2 D6 hours on average, although vigilant maintenance or advanced protective gear can prolong survival times. Dense, High (D): These worlds have thick N2/O2 atmospheres, but their mean surface pressure is too high to support unprotected human life (high pressure nitrogen and oxy gen are deadly to humans). However, pressure naturally decreases with increasing altitude, so if there are highlands at the right altitude the pressure may drop enough to support human life. Alternatively, there may not be any topography high enough for hu mans to inhabit, necessitating floating gravitic or dirigible habitats or sealed habitats on the surface. Thin, Low (E): The opposite of the Dense, High atmosphere, these massive worlds have thin N2/O2 atmospheres that settle in the lowlands and depressio ns and are only breathable there – the pressure drops off so rapidly with altitude that the highest topographic points of the surface may be close to vacuum. Unusual (F): An Unusual atmosphere is a catchall term for an atmosphere that behaves in a strange manner. Examples include ellipsoidal atmospheres, which are thin at the poles and dense at the equator; Panthalassic worlds composed of a rocky core surrounded by a water layer hundreds of kilometers thick; worlds wracked by storms so intense that that the local air pressure changes from dense to thin depending on the current weather; and other planets with unusual and hazardous atmospheric conditions.

The Referee might also roll on the 1 D6 Animal Encounter Table Template to randomly choose an animal type. Once the animal type has been determined, the Referee rolls 2 D6, and add in the terrain’s Subtype DM.

Cepheus Engine SRD 189 Samardan Pre ss Format for Patron Encounters Some Referees prefer to “wing it,” and consider little more than a patron’s name and the mission at hand. However, for those seeking a more detailed way of creating reusable patron encounters, the Cepheus Engine rules offers a fairly comprehensive format for recording patron encounters. This format identifies five specific elements for a given patron. These are: • The patron’s name and role. Names can be changed if the patron encounter is reused. • The skills and resources required to complete the mission • The suggested reward for the mission • The mission as described to the characters • What’s really going on. Several possible variants are presented – either pick or roll for which is the real situation. This is the key element that allows reusability. Here is an example of a patron encounter captured in this format: Bruce Ayala, Interplanetary Playboy Required: Investigate, Streetwise; No special equipment required. Reward: Cr500 a day, plus expenses; minimum of two weeks. Players’ Information Word on the street is that the famous holovid star and interplanetary playboy B ruce Ayala is cruising the local bar scene. That night, Bruce Ayala, along with his entourage of publicists and models, staggers into the same locale as the party and buys a round for every offworlder. Over the course of the evening, he continually hounds the party for details of their exploits, always comparing their adventures to roles he's portrayed. Late into the evening, Ayala corners one of the party members and offers the crew a job, if it can be handled with discretion. He provides contact informati on, and arranges a meeting to discuss terms, if they are interested. Referee’s Information When Bruce Ayala achieved system -wide fame as a holovid star, he admits that it went right to his head, and it cost him the love of a wonderful young woman by the n ame of Martha McKernan. He's kept tabs on Martha over the years through private investigators and the like, one of whom has reported that she's gone missing a few days ago. Ayala wants to hire the party to discretely investigate Martha's disappearance, loc ate the young woman and rescue her from whatever situation she might be in. He's concerned that his current media distributor, Penultimate Productions, have pulled something, as he has been secretly planning to sign a new contract with a competitor, System Media Studios. That represents a great loss for Penultimate Productions, and Ayala feels that they are not above coercion to insure the holovid star continues to bring them money. In all of the options presented below, further development is left to the d iscretion of the Referee. 1. All is as it appears. Bruce Ayala is correct; Penultimate Productions has discovered their star's clandestine plans. Slowly moving away from the verge of bankruptcy, the media distributor owes their recovery to Bruce Ayala's succe ss in the box office. Worried that the star's departure could cost them everything, the executive producers have hired thugs to kidnap Martha McKernan and use her to force him to extend his current contract. 2. Sadly, Bruce Ayala is incorrect. His own agent, Cornelius Brass, has a gambling problem, a huge gambling problem. He's fallen in so much debt to the local crime syndicate that they've started threatening his life and the lives of his family, and the man has become desperate. Brass has arranged for the k idnapping of Martha McKernan, hoping to ransom her to enough Credits to pay off his debt and tuck away a tidy bankroll so he can continue his gambling habit.

Cepheus Engine SRD 190 Samardan Pre ss 3. Bruce Ayala has been less than truthful. He's been stalking the innocent Martha McKernan for years, using his fame and fortune to attempt to force her into marrying him. In an act of desperation, Martha has gone on the run, trying to make her way out of the star system undetected in an effort to find safety from Ayala's overwhelming attentions. 4. System Media Studios has kidnapped Martha McKernan as a form of leverage to use on Bruce Ayala in the event he changes his mind and backs out of the secret negotiations. They believe he is unaware of her disappearance, and only intend to reveal her status as a pr isoner should he start entertaining the thought of extending his current contract with Penultimate Productions. 5. Martha McKernan has watched Bruce Ayala's meteoric rise to success with envy and jealousy. She feels scorned by the holovid star, and every imag e of Bruce Ayala with some starlet has pushed her further into the depths of hatred and loathing. Martha has arranged her own "kidnapping", so that she can demand a costly ransom from Bruce. Any extended contact with Martha will reveal that she is not comp letely sane, and will likely go to extreme lengths to harm and humiliate Bruce Ayala. 6. Martha McKernan is actually on vacation, hiking deep in a wilderness preserve to get away from civilization for a few weeks. Edmund Sang, a private investigator employed by Bruce Ayala, has reported her missing simply to get more money from Mr. Ayala to "locate" her. When the party shows up and begins investigating, he realizes that he might get caught and so desperately attempts to redirect them, to avoid having his decep tion discovered. Sang's efforts to create a false trail points to the local crime syndicate, who do not take kindly to the party investigating their illicit activities looking for a girl they've never heard of. Rumors Rumors are best thought of as encount ers with information rather than with people or events. Rumors often fill one of two different roles: they plant the seed for a potential new adventure, or they provide background information that makes the universe seem larger than just the character's ex periences. Rumors can take many forms, including, but not limited to, graffiti on the walls, newspaper or online articles, overheard conversations, secret notes, and televised broadcasts. Because rumors are encounters with information, the player character has no patron should they decide to pursue the rumor itself. If the matter doesn't pan out, the player character has no one to blame but himself. However, given the promise of potential reward, enterprising characters are likely to attempt to exploit the information they've uncovered. Random encounters are often determined by rolling a D66 on a table such as the Random Rumor Content table presented in these rules.

The characters can then try to influence the character's attitude using Social Standing and various interaction sk ills, such as Liaison and Carousing. The Attitude Descriptions table describes the effects of character attitudes. Table: Attitude Descriptions Attitude Means Possible Actions Hostile Will take risks to oppose you Attack, interfere, berate, flee Unfrie ndly Wishes you ill Mislead, gossip, avoid, watch suspiciously, insult Indifferent Doesn't care either way Socially acceptable interaction Friendly Wishes you well Chat, advise, offer limited help, advocate Helpful Will take risks to aid you Protect, ba ck up, heal, aid, support Characters can attempt to improve another's attitude, using a Difficult ( -2) Social Standing -based check using the appropriate skill, usually Liaison. With a success, the character's attitude is improved by one step; with an exceptional success, the attitude improves by two steps. Note that a particularly bad influence check can actually make a character's attitude worse. On an exceptional failure, the character's attitude shifts one step more Hostile. In general, a character can attempt to influence another character only once in any given scene. Players get to choose their characters’ attitudes, and so interaction skills cannot force a player -character to behave in a specific way. Typically, the only way a player character can be forced into a particular behavior is through the use of psionics or some other external force.

Cepheus Engine SRD 192 Samardan Pre ss CHAPTER 15: STARSHIP ENCOUNTERS Space is amazingly vast, and starships are incredibly small in comparison. Aside from points where people tend to congregate, such as within 100 diameters of inhabited planets or potential refueling locations, the chances of encountering another vessel is small enough to essentially occur only at the Referee's discretion. Random encounters with intelligent beings in such areas a re extremely unlikely, and player -characters would be correct in assuming that such an encounter was not a random occurrence. Referees are encouraged to simply use the Astrogation Encounter Type table for random encounters under such conditions, simply to avoid violating the players' suspension of disbelief by providing generally non -starship encounters. However, within those regions of interplanetary space where people congregate, there's always a chance for a space encounter. As a general rule of thumb, t he Referee should check for space encounters when entering or leaving such a region. Roll 1 D6; on a 6, a space encounter occurs. Referees may determine the type of space encounter based on the events occurring within the game, or they may randomly determin e the type of encounter by rolling 2 D6 and consulting the Space Encounters table. Each entry on the Space Encounters table is supported by a sub -table; the Referee can roll 1 D6 and consult the sub -table for a more specific example of a random encounter if needed. Like any random encounter system, if a result doesn't make sense for the current location in the game, then feel free to ignore it and roll again, or better yet, choose a result that does make sense. Encounter Range If two vessels randomly encount er each other while travelling in the depths of interplanetary space, the encounter will begin at Very Long range. More often, ships engage near a planet at Medium range. If the characters do not succeed in a Comms check (as modified by any stealth efforts made by the other vessel), then the encounter begins at one range category closer (Long instead of Very Long, or Short instead of Medium). Most civilian vessels, as well as military vessels that are not currently engaged in maneuvers, have transponders that operate as an "Identification Friend or Foe" (IFF) system to differentiate friendly from enemy spacecraft on sensors. When these are active, other vessels gain a DM+4 on detection efforts. (It is generally against interstellar law to operate a civilian vessel without such a transponder, but some ship crews have been known to disconnect their transponders when engaging in illicit activities.) Some encounters, such as the starship encounter types, ignore the general rules for range, and instead occur at a range determined by the Referee. Space Encounter Descriptions Most of the entries on the space encounter tables are self -explanatory. However, some encounters have special rules that require further explanation. Comet: Dust and particles from the comet in terfere with some sensors, imposing a DM -2 on Comms skill checks while in the comet's tail. An unusual object or vessel may be found at the heart of a comet, but such occurrences are very rare and reaching such sites imposes a risk of impact with space deb ris. Debris from collision or attack, Lost equipment or garbage, and Micrometeorite storm: The vessel is in danger of being impacted by small objects with great force. The vessel suffers 1D6 damage for every point of the vessel’s Thrust rating, unless the pilot succeeds in a Pilot skill check to avoid the debris. Interplanetary dust cloud: Dust clouds interfere with some sensors, imposing a -2 on Comms skill checks while in the cloud. The Referee may impose a second space encounter within the cloud, or simp ly impose a risk of impact with space debris. Jettisoned cargo pod: For some reason, another vessel has jettisoned its cargo into space, generally to protect the safety of its crew from physical threats or legal actions. The contents of the pod can be dete rmined randomly as per the trade goods rules in Chapter 7: Trade and Commerce, and often come with complications related to who dropped it and why.
