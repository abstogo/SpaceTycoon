Cepheus Engine SRD 13 Samardan Pre ss by the Referee. The players describe their actions, and the Referee describes the results of those actions, in a back -and-forth exchange. Certain kinds of situations, such as personal or space combat, have more structure and more rules to help the players resolve their actions in ways reflecting the abilities of th eir characters. Common Cepheus Engine Themes On-going games using the Cepheus Engine rules are generally designed around a theme. Based in the classic era of science fiction, these rules lend themselves to games following certain common themes, which are detailed in the Common Cepheus Engine Themes table. This is not a complete list of the type of games that the Cepheus Engine is designed to handle; this is simply a general list of common themes for consideration. Table: Common Cepheus Engine Themes Theme Description Colonial The adventurers are on the borders of explored space, helping to select a new world for a colony and then settle it. These campaigns allow a group to develop a single world extensively. Commerce The adventurers live aboard a frontie r trader or merchant trader, making a living through the transport of freight, passengers, speculative cargo and the occasional odd job. These campaigns heavily explore the trade and commerce rules. Drifter The adventurers constantly move from place to pl ace, without any fixed home or job, seeking employment through odd jobs as they explore the universe that the Referee has created. These campaigns are sometimes called "Sandbox Campaigns" because they explore an area that has been previously created and po pulated by the Referee. Espionage The adventurers all belong to the same government or corporate intelligence agency, and make a living by going on spy missions against their enemies. These campaigns tend to be more episodic than other common campaign the mes. Exploration The adventurers serve aboard a survey vessel, making a living travelling through previously uncharted regions of space, exploring strange new worlds, and seeking out new life and new civilizations as they boldly go where no sophont has go ne before. These campaigns make heavy use of the rules for generating worlds. Mercenary The adventurers all belong to the same mercenary unit, making a living by participating in military actions in the hire of an interested party to the conflict. These c ampaigns make significant use of the personal combat rules, with a particular focus on large -scale military scenarios. Political The adventurers are heavily involved in the social and political arena of an interstellar polity, dealing with diplomats, nobl es and other factions with vested interests in controlling aspects of the government. These campaigns tend to focus on diplomacy and political intrigue. Rebellion The adventurers are involved in a blossoming civil war, seeking either to preserve or overth row the current government. These campaigns typically start with intrigue and end with action. Die Rolls Using the Cepheus Engine, when you have to make a die roll to resolve an action, it will typically follow the core system of a 2 D6 roll plus modifier s versus a target of 8+ ( read as eight or higher). This is called a check. You always want to roll high on a check. Rolling 12 before adding modifiers (where two sixes appear on the dice naturally) is not an automatic success, and rolling 2 before adding m odifiers (where both dice show a one naturally) is not an automatic failure.

Cepheus Engine SRD 16 Samardan Pre ss The Combat Round When things really start happening in a Cepheus Engine game, time is broken down into six -second segments called rounds, or combat rounds, since they're most often used in fights. A round isn't very much time, just long enough for a cha racter to do something. The types of actions your character can perform during a round are significant actions, minor actions, extended actions, free actions, and reactions. During a round you can do one of the following: • Initiate or continue an extended action. • Take a significant action and a minor action. • Take three minor actions, and forego taking a significant action this turn. You can perform as many free actions and reactions in a round as you wish, although the Referee may choose to limit them to a reasonable number to keep the game moving. See Chapter 5: Personal Combat for more information. Pseudo -Hexadecimal Notation The Cepheus Engine uses a form of pseudo -hexadecimal notation as a type of shorthand in noting specific values of characteristic scores, world statistics, drive type designations and similar design elements. The pseudo - hexadecimal notation proceeds as normal for values from 0 to 15, but extends beyond F for 15, with G for 16, etc. The Cepheus Engine skips the use of the letters I a nd O, because they might be mistaken for the numbers 1 and 0. The Pseudo -Hexadecimal Notation table provides a quick reference for converting values for use in Cepheus Engine. Table: Pseudo -Hexadecimal Notation Actual Value PseudoHex Actual Value PseudoHe x Actual Value PseudoHex 0 0 12 C 24 Q 1 1 13 D 25 R 2 2 14 E 26 S 3 3 15 F 27 T 4 4 16 G 28 U 5 5 17 H 29 V 6 6 18 J 30 W 7 7 19 K 31 X 8 8 20 L 32 Y 9 9 21 M 33 Z 10 A 22 N 11 B 23 P Important Terms The Cepheus Engine uses certain words and abbreviations throughout the rules system. In order properly understand the Cepheus Engine rules, both players and Referees should become familiar with these terms. The following words, phrases and abbreviations are commonly used in The Cepheus Engine: 2D6: Two six -sided dice, used to resolve all actions in the Cepheus Engine. Action: A character activity. There are significant actions, minor actions, extended actions, free actions, and reactions. Adventure: A story created by the Referee and players, comprised of a series of related scenes or encounters. Attack bonus: A modifier used to measure a character's combat skill. Attack roll: A skill check used to determine whether an attack hits. Attack: Any of numerous actions intended to harm, disable, or neutralize an opponent.

Cepheus Engine SRD 17 Samardan Pre ss Bonus: A positive modifier to a die roll. Campaign: A series of linked adventures. Character: A fictional individual in the game. The players control characters, while the Referee controls non - player characters. Characteristic modi fier: A modifier determined by the value of the characteristic score, applied as a bonus or penalty to checks as needed. Characteristic score: One of the six basic character traits -- Strength (Str), Dexterity (Dex), Endurance (End), Intelligence (Int), Ed ucation (Edu), and Social Standing (Soc). Check (or Throw): A method of deciding the result of a character's action. Checks are based on a relevant ability, skill, or other trait. To make a check, roll 2 D6 and add any relevant modifiers. If the check resul t equals or exceeds a target of 8 or the result of an opponent's check, it succeeds. Coreward: An astrographical term indicating the direction of Sagittarius A* (pronounced "Sagittarius A -star", standard abbreviation Sgr A*), a bright and very compact astr onomical radio source at the center of the Milky Way galaxy. Credit (Cr): The primary unit of currency used in the Cepheus Engine. For very large amounts of money, the kilocredit (KCr) represents one thousand credits and the megacredit (MCr) represents one million credits. Critical hit (crit): An attack inflicting extra damage. Critical hits are only involved in vehicular and space combat. D66: A special die roll generated by rolling two six -sided dice of different colors (or rolling one die twice, noting each number rolled ), multiplying the first die by 10 and then adding the second die, to create a number between 11 and 66. Damage bonus: A modifier used to determine the damage of an attack. Damage: Harm caused to a character by injury, illness, or some ot her source. Dice modifier (DM): A modifier applied to a check. Die (plural is dice): A small polyhedron, typically a cube, with each side having a different number on it, ranging from one to the number of sides of the polyhedron, thrown and used in gamblin g and other games involving chance. The Cepheus Engine uses six -sided dice exclusively to create random results during play. Difficulty: A modifier applied to a check that is assigned by the Referee, reflecting the relative ease or difficulty of a given ac tion. Dominant race: A sentient species capable of interstellar travel via jump drive technology, and that has used that technology to expand their presence over a significant region of space. Dominant Races typically control a fairly expansive interstella r government, and have settlements and significant populations more than ten parsecs away from their planet of origin. Dying: Near death and unconscious. A dying character can take no actions. Effect: The difference between a check result and the target of 8 (i.e. how much higher or lower the result is). Encounter: An unexpected or casual meeting with someone or something. A large part of the Referee’s job is the administration of encounters. Explorer's Society: A private interstellar travel service which maintains exclusive resorts and facilities at various starports. Several interstellar organizations provide membership to the Explorer's Society as a reward for outstanding service. Exceptional failure: Any check that fails by 6 or greater (i.e. has an Eff ect of -6 or worse). Exceptional success: Any check that succeeds by 6 or greater (i.e. has an Effect of +6 or better). Extended action: An action in combat that takes longer than a single combat round to complete. Free action: An extremely fast activity, requiring very little time and effort. Homeworld: 1) The world that serves as a character’s place of origin, usually the world on which the character was raised and which had the most impact on their development during their pre -adult life. 2) The world of origin for an alien species, i.e. Earth is the homeworld for the human species. Jump: A form of faster -than -light movement using Jump drives, which always takes one week to travel a number of parsecs equal to its Jump rating and consumes a vast amount of fuel.

Cepheus Engine SRD 43 Samardan Pre ss Reptilians are driven by a strong sense of territoriality and a primal need to hunt. After discovering Ju mp Drive, the Reptilians found themselves with entire new worlds to claim. Game Mechanics Reptilians have Notable Strength (2 D6+1), Notable Dexterity (2d+1) and Weak Endurance (2 D6-2). Reptilians also possess the Anti -Psionic, Fast Speed (9m), Heat Endura nce, Low -Light Vision, Natural Weapon (teeth) and Low Gravity Adaptation traits. Reptilians reach maturity at 22, start aging at 42, stand 155+(2 D6x5) centimeters tall, and have a mass of 50+(2 D6x5) kilograms. Alien Species Trait Descriptions Many of the races in this section possess unusual racial traits, which are described below.  Amphibious: A member of this species is adapted to life underwater as well as on land. It can breathe underwater, or hold its breath for a long period (Endurance x10 minutes on average). Its Dexterity is halved on land.  Anti -Psionic: Members of this species are innately anti -psionic. The character’s Psionic Strength rating always equals zero, and they cannot be trained in psionics. In addition, the character cannot suffer the men tal effects of psionics, including telepathy and psionic assault. A species cannot have this alien trait if they already have the Psionic alien trait.  Aquatic: The alien is adapted to life underwater. It can breathe underwater, or hold its breath for a lon g period (Endurance x10 minutes on average). If amphibious, its Dexterity is halved on land. If the species is not amphibious, then it cannot operate out of water without mechanical aid or telepresence.  Armored: The alien possess thick fur, scales, a bony exoskeleton or other natural protection that gives it one point of natural armor.  Atmospheric Requirements: The species requires an unusual combination of gasses to breathe, and cannot survive in most atmospheres without artificial aid.  Bad First Impressio n: Members of this species possess an almost universally unpleasant appearance or physical trait that invokes an instinctive reaction in races other than their own. Most races will automatically have an Unfriendly attitude towards these characters, althoug h this is overcome after an individual has interacted with the character for a few minutes, based on the character’s personality and the circumstances of their interaction.  Caste: Members of this species have a genetic structure for social hierarchy. When dealing with races that use Social Standing or Charisma, all social attribute DMs, whether positive or negative, are halved.  Cold -Blooded: Members of this species are sensitive to cold climates. If exposed to extreme cold without protective equipment, the character suffers a DM –2 to initiative. The character suffers 1 D6 damage for every ten minutes of exposure.  Engineered: The species has been altered by some external factor to adapt to changed circumstances or a different environment. Medical treatment of Engineered species by a facility of a lower Technology Level than that at which the species was created receives a negative DM equal to the difference.  Fast Metabolism: Creatures with a fast metabolism require more food than most species, and their life support costs are doubled. In combat, fast -metabolism creatures gain a +2 initiative bonus. Fast -metabolism creatures halve their Endurance for the purposes of determining fatigue.  Feral: Feral species are uncivilised, regardless of their technological knowl edge. Feral species roll Education on 1d6 only.  Flyer: This species can fly using wings. Characters of this species gain the Athletics skill at Level 0 and can travel at a speed noted in their description. Flying creatures that are aloft must spend one min or action every round on movement or stall and fall out of the air. Winged flight is tiring and can only be sustained for a number of hours equal to the creature’s Endurance before r equiring a like amount of rest.

Cepheus Engine SRD 50 Samardan Pre ss Bay Weapons The character is skilled at operating bay weapons on board a ship. Bludgeoning Weapons The character is skilled at using bludgeoning weapons, such as clubs, staffs and really big wrenches, in personal combat. Bribery The character has experience in bribing petty and not -so petty officials in order to circumvent regulati ons or ignore cumbersome laws. The amount of a bribe is often based on the level of offense, as outlined in the Bribery Checks By Offense table. Table: Bribery Checks By Offense Offense DM Minimum Bribe Petty Crime or Infraction +2 1D6xCr10 Misdemeanor, Minor Infraction +0 1D6xCr50 Serious Crime or Infraction -2 1D6xCr100 Capital Crime or Infraction -4 1D6xCr500 If the bribe is less than the minimum bribe required, the attempt will automatically fail. Characters may offer more than the minimum bribe required and receive a +1 DM for each multiple of the bribe offered. If the first offer is refused, a character may make a second attempt at twice the previous value of the bribe. If both attempts are refused (failed), the Referee should have the character make a Social Standing check, with a Difficulty based on Base Difficulty by Law Level table. If this also fails, the character will be brought up on charges of attempted bribery. For example, a character trying to bribe an official to ignore a minor smugg ling infraction would have to offer a minimum bribe of Cr200. If the character offered Cr400 instead the character could gain a +1 DM on the check. If Cr600 were offered, the character could gain a +2 DM, etc. Broker A broker is skilled in locating suppli ers and buyers, and facilitating the purchase and resale of commercial goods, as per the Trade and Commerce rules. Carousing This skill reflects the interpersonal art of interacting and socializing with others. The character is skilled in the art of small talk and making others feel at ease in their presence in almost any social situation, such as a party, ball, inauguration, bar hopping, etc. Comms The character is trained in the use, repair, and maintenance of communications and sensor devices. While anyone can press the button and make a communicator function, this skill is necessary to understand why the device does not work, or how to use the device for purposes other than open transmission. When using sensors, this skill allows the character to inter pret the long -range data of a ship's sensors and scanners. Skilled characters can boost an incoming or outgoing signal, create or break a secure channel, detect signals and anomalies, hide or piggyback on another signal, jam local communications, locate an d assess potential threats, and analyze complex sensor data.

Cepheus Engine SRD 51 Samardan Pre ss Computer The character is skilled in the programming and operation of electronic and fiber optic computers, both ground and shipboard models. Computers can be found on any world with a TL of 8 o r higher, becoming exponentially more common at higher technology levels. A character without at least some computer training might find himself at disadvantage in the highly technical universe of science fiction. Anyone with Computer -0 or better can perfo rm the following without a skill check: Log on to a Datanet, send and receive messages, search for non -classified information, and retrieve data and files. More skilled users can create or break data encryption; mine data effectively; create or break data and network security protocols; and perform other general programming tasks. Demolitions This skill covers the use of demolition charges and other explosive devices, including assembling or disarming bombs. Electronics The character is practiced in insta lling, using, maintaining, repairing and/or creating electronic devices and equipment. The character can practice a trade and make a decent living, earning a paycheck for every week of dedicated work. The character knows how to use the tools of the trade, how to perform routine tasks, how to supervise untrained helpers, and how to handle common problems. Disabling Devices: The character is skilled at disarming alarm systems, picking electronic locks, disabling a malfunctioning robot, or similar tasks involv ing electronic devices. Energy Pistol The character is skilled at using advanced pistol -style energy weapons like laser pistols and stunners. Energy Rifle The character is skilled at using advanced energy weapons like laser rifles or plasma rifles. Engi neering The character is skilled in the operation and maintenance of starship maneuver drives, Jump drives, and power plants. The character can practice a trade and make a decent living, earning a paycheck for every week of dedicated work. The character kn ows how to use the tools of the trade, how to perform routine tasks, how to supervise untrained helpers, and how to handle common problems. Engineering is particularly important in diverting power to the Jump Drives for a successful transition into Jump sp ace. Farming The character can grow and harvest crops and raise animals. This also covers hydroponic farming and clone harvesting for food production, at sufficiently high tech levels. Gambling The individual is well informed on games of chance, and wise in their play. He or she has an advantage over non - experts, and is generally capable of winning when engaged in such games. Gambling, however, should not be confused with general risk -taking. Non -Competitive Games: These are games such as Slots, Roulette, Blackjack, Keno, etc. These games are played strictly against the house and the odds are pretty much constant, as are the payoff values. The character chooses a game by its odds of winning (high, average, low, small or remote) and places a bet. The Refere e determines if the game is rigged. The character then rolls their Gambling score. On a success, the character receives the payoff amount based on the amount of their initial bet. House always wins on a natural 2.

This skill represents the character's ability to provide animals with emergency care, short term care, long -term care, and specialized treatment for diseases, poisons and debilitating injuries. Watercraft (Cascade Skill) The various specialties of this skill cover different types of watercraft and ocean travel. When this skill is received, the character must immediately select one of the following: Motorboats, Ocean Ships, Sailing Ships or Submarine.

Cepheus Engine SRD 59 Samardan Pre ss Each talen t grants access to all of its powers – a character with Telepathy 0 can use life detection, read surface thoughts or assault as the situation demands. Using a Psionic Talent To activate a talent, the psion must make a skill check using the appropriate tal ent (Telepathy, Telekinesis, etc), adding his Psionic Strength characteristic DM and any other DMs. He must also spend the listed number of Psionic Strength points if he succeeds, or one point if he fails. If this cost brings him below zero Psionic Strengt h, then any excess points are applied to his Endurance score as damage. A character with no Psionic Strength points cannot attempt to activate a power. Using a talent in combat is a significant action. Many abilities are ranged. The Psionic Range table lis ts th e number of points to project psionic abilit ies out to a given range – these must be paid as well as any points to activate the ability. Each talent has a different set of costs, with the exception of Awareness – all Awareness abilities apply to the P sion only. Range Psionic range costs are paid based on range bands based on those used in personal combat or communication devices. These are defined in the Psionic Range Costs table.

A character with Awareness may enter a suspended animation state (similar to cold sleep but without the intrinsic danger of death) by willing himself into it. Such a state continues for 7 days without need for food or water and with minimal air needs. Such a person could effectively travel in a low passage berth without actually undergoing co ld sleep and its dangers.

Cepheus Engine SRD 63 Samardan Pre ss Shield All telepathically able characters learn how to create a mental shield which p rotects the mind against unwanted telepathic interference. Shield is automatically in force at all times and requires no Psionic Strength point expenditure to maintain. However, while a telepath has his shield up he cannot use any telepathic powers either. Shield can be lowered to allow telepathic contact or to use telepathic powers – this takes a mere thought (a free action in combat). Teleportation Teleportation is a talent which allows effectively instantaneous movement from one point to another point without regard to intervening matter. Psionic teleportation is limited to the movement of the teleported character's body and (for highly skilled teleporters) his or her clothing and other possessions. Table: Teleportation Ability Difficulty Timing Cost Teleport self, unclothed Average (+0) 1D6 seconds 0+Range Teleport self, light load Difficult ( -2) 1D6 seconds 2+Range Teleport self, moderate load Very Difficult ( -4) 1D6 seconds 3+Range Teleport self, heavy load Very Difficult ( -4) 1D6 seconds 4+Ran ge Teleportation always involves the movement of one's body to another location. Independent items or other individuals may not be moved. Teleportation involves certain requirements in order to be accurate, and to insure obedience of the laws of physics. Pre-Knowledge of Destination: A character must always have a mental image of his or her destination before teleporting. This mental image is acquired by personally visiting the location first (or viewing it from a distance), having the mental image implan ted in one's mind (by telepathy) by another person who has visited the destination, or by viewing the location through clairvoyance. The key to remember is that someone has to actually view the location – recorded images are not enough. Energy and Momentum: Teleportation involves serious restrictions on movement in order to assure the conservation of energy and momentum. On planetary surfaces, teleportation is restricted to jumps of Very Distant range or less. Jumps at Very Distant range involve disorienta tion for a period of 20 to 120 seconds (2 D6x10) after arrival. This restriction results from the law of conservation of momentum: on a rotating planet, two locations will have different rotational speeds and directions. A jump from a point on the Earth's e quator to one of its poles would result in a total velocity difference between the character and his surroundings of over 3300 kph, which would lead to a messy death in short order. Teleporting to or from vehicles travelling at high speed can also result in energy gains or losses. When teleporting into, onto or out of a fast -moving vehicle the psion takes damage as if the vehicle had rammed him at its current speed. Changes in altitude (actually all movement to locations of differing gravitational potentia l) will result in potential energy changes, manifesting themselves as changes in body temperature. A jump of one kilometer straight down will result in a temperature increase of 2.5 degrees Celsius; this is sufficient to cause extreme fever, brain damage, and even death. A jump up will cool the body by the same amount, with equally serious results. To be safe, a jump may not involve an elevation change of more than 400 meters, and multiple jumps should not involve a cumulative elevation change or more than 600 meters in one hour. These problems may be gotten around through the use of technological devices: energy compensators, heated suits, and other means. Characters may feel driven to invent such materials, commission their invention, or seek them out from those who already have them.

Cepheus Engine SRD 64 Samardan Pre ss Psionic Technology In a Cepheus Engine universe where psionic abilities are possible, the following psionic -related technology may be available, either legally or on the black market. Inhibitor Drug (TL 9): Psionic inhibitor s dampen the brain's ability to generate psychic effects. A character who takes (or, more often, is forcibly injected with) an inhibitor drug suffers a –4 DM to all Psionic Strength checks and cannot regain Psionic Strength points. Each hour the character may make an Endurance check to throw off the effects of the drug with a +1 DM for every previous check. Inhibitor drugs have no effect on non -psionic individuals. The drugs cost Cr500 per dose. Psi-Drugs (TL 8+): These drugs restore Psionic Strength if ta ken when the character has already spent Psionic Strength points, or temporarily increase the character's Psionic Strength if taken when he is at full Psionic Stren gth, as given in the Psi -Drug Effects and Cost table. Table: Psi -Drug Effects and Cost Drug TL Psionic Strength Restored Psionic Strength Boosted Cost (Cr ) Standard 8 3 2 1,000 Double 9 6 4 4,000 Special 10 9 6 10,000 A character who takes more than one dose of Standard or Double Psi -Drug, or a single dose of the Special drug must make an E ndurance check, with a –1 DM per dose of psi -drug taken in the last week (not including the one just taken). If the check is failed the character falls ill with a serious fever, suffering 3 D6 damage and permanently reducing his Psionic Strength by one. Psionic Shield (TL 12): Any armor incorporating a helmet or hood can be outfitted with a psionic shield, blocking Telepathy. Unlike the Telepathy power shield a technological shield is invulnerable to assault and blocks send thoughts. It cannot be lowered wi thout removing the helmet or hood containing the shield. Cr40,000. Buildings and vehicles can also be psionically shielded, but this is much more costly, increasing the cost by 10%. Teleportation Suit (TL 12): This device can be integrated into a suit of a rmor or worn as a form -hugging body - suit. It rapidly cools or warms the body after a teleport, minimizing the damage from sudden energy gains or losses. The suit costs Cr50,000 and allows a character to jump up to 600 meters up or down in a single teleport, or up to ten kilometers in a single hour when using successive jumps. Psionic Interface (TL 14): Any weapon or technological device can be outfitted with a psionic interface. A character using a device with a psionic interface can use his Psionic Strengt h DM instead of his Dexterity DM when using the weapon or device; a character without psionic ability cannot use the device. The character must either touch the device or use telekinesis to interact with it at range. Adding a psionic interface increases th e cost of the device by 20%. Psionics in Society The Cepheus Engine assumes that there are generally three different mindsets in which a society might view psionics. In generic terms, these categories are called Psi -Hostile, Psi -Neutral and Psi -Friendly. Psi-Hostile Societies Humanity fears what it doesn't understand. In Psi -Hostile societies, some precipitating event has brought that fear into the court of public opinion, and as a result, psionics became banned. In the least offensive case, the use of ps ionics is forbidden and violations are punished as a capital crime. In the worst cases, governments and

Cepheus Engine SRD 68 Samardan Pre ss Hostile Environment Vacc Suit (TL 8): Hostile environment suits are designed for conditions where a normal vacc suit would be insufficient, such as deep underwater, worlds shrouded in toxic or corrosive gases, extremes of radiation or temperature, or other locales that offer serious physical danger as well as the lack of a breathable atmosphere. HEV suits provide all the life support offered by a normal vacc suit (for six hours) but are also impervious to flames, intense radiation such as that found at nuclear blast sites (decreasing radiation exposure by 180 rads), and high pressure environments like undersea trenches. Jack (TL 1): A natura l or synthetic leather jacket or body suit covering the torso and upper arms and legs. Mesh (TL 6): A jacket or body suit lined with a flexible metal or plastic mesh that gives it added protection against bullets. Reflec (TL 10): Reflec armor is a flexib le plastic suit with layers of reflective material and heat -dispersing gel. It is highly effective against lasers, but provides no protection against other attacks. Reflec can be worn with other armor. Vacc Suit (TL 8): The vacc suit or space suit is the s pacer's best friend, providing life support and protection when in space. A vacc suit provides a breathable atmosphere and protection from the extremes of temperature, low pressure and radiation typically found in a hard vacuum (decreasing exposure by up t o 40 rads), for six hours. Communicators Characters separated by physical location often have a need to maintain communications. These examples of communications equipment fulfill that need. Routine use of these devices does not require a skill check. Wh en attempting to overcome interference or use these devices for other purposes, the Comms skill check is used. Table: Communications Equipment Communicator TL Cost Wgt Range Long Range Communicator 6 Cr500 15 kg 500 km Medium Range Communicator 5 Cr200 10 kg 30 km Short Range Communicator 5 Cr100 5 kg 10 km Personal Communicator 8 Cr250 0.3 kg Special Long Range Communicator: Back -pack mounted radio capable of ranges up to 500 km and contact with ships in orbit. Ten separate channe ls. At tech level 7 reduce the weight to 1.5 kg and it becomes belt or sling mounted. Medium Range Communicator: Belt -mounted or sling carried radio set capable of up to 30 km range, and contact with official radio channels. Five separate channels. At tech level 7, reduce the weight to 500 grams. Short Range Communicator: Belt -mounted radio capable of 10 km range (much shorter underground or underwater). Three separate channels. At tech level 7 reduce the weight to 300 grams and it becomes hand - held. Person al Communicator: A hand -held, single channel communication device. On world with a tech level of 8 or higher a personal communicator is able to tap into the world's satellite communication network and with the proper address, contact any other communicator in the world (for a fee). The channel is private, but not secure and may be monitored on some worlds. Usually network access can be arranged at the local starport for a small fee. On worlds with a tech level of 7 or less, personal communicators will not w ork. Computer s The power of a computer is given by its rating ( Model 1, Model 2 and so forth), which measures the complexity of the programs it can run. (Storage space is effectively unlimited at TL 9 and above.) Programs are rated by the computer rating they require. A system can run a number of programs up to its rating.

Cepheus Engine SRD 69 Samardan Pre ss The computers listed here are laptop size. Battery life is two hours at TL 7, eight hours at TL 8, and effectively unlimited at TL 9 and above. Desktop computers offer a slightly greate r amount of processing power for the same cost but not enough to make a difference in -game. Desktops become obsolete during TL 8. Table: Computers by TL Optimum TL Computer Power Mass (kg) Cost (Cr) TL 7 Model 0 10 50 TL 8 Model 1 5 100 TL 9 Model 1 5 250 TL 10 Model 2 1 350 TL 11 Model 2 1 500 TL 12 Model 3 0.5 1,000 TL 13 Model 4 0.5 1,500 TL 14 Model 5 0.5 5,000 Computer Terminal (TL 7): This is a ‘dumb terminal’, with only limited processing power. It serves as an interface to a more powerfu l computer such as a ship’s computer or planetary network. Terminals range in size depending on their control method – a holographic display terminal can be much smaller than one with a physical keyboard and screen. A computer terminal has Model 0, and cos ts Cr200. Hand Computer (TL 7): A hand computer is a portable computer system with considerable processing power. It is more powerful than a computer terminal, and can be used without access to a network. A hand computer costs twice as much as a normal co mputer of the same TL but can he held in one hand and operated with the other. Computer Options Data Display/Recorder (TL 13): This headpiece worn over one or both eyes provides a continuous heads -up display for the user, allowing him to view computer dat a from any linked system. Because of the transparent screen vision is not obscured while using a DD/R headset. DD/Rs can display data from any system, not just computers – they can display vacc suit oxygen reserves, grav belt status, neural activity scanne r results and so forth. Cr5,000. Data Wafer (TL 10): The principle medium of information storage is the standard data wafer, a rectangle of hardened plastic about the size of a credit card. A TL 10 data wafer is memory diamond, with information encoded in structures of carbon atoms; more advanced wafers use more exotic means of data storage. Cr5. Specialized Computer: A computer can be designed for a specific purpose, which gives it a Rating of 1 or 2 higher for that program only. The navigation computer o n a starship might be only a Model 1, but it could run the Expert Navigation/3 program because it is specially designed for that task. A specialized computer costs 25% more per added Rating. In addition, when working out how many programs the computer can run simultaneously, the program that the computer is specialized for does not count against that total. Computer Software A character can use any high -rating software at a lower rating, to a minimum of the lowest rating shown. Programs above Rating/1 ca nnot be copied easily, as they require a non -trivial amount of bandwidth to transfer.

Cepheus Engine SRD 71 Samardan Pre ss Drugs Medica tions often supplement the direct medical attention of a trained health professional. The following drugs are commonly encountered in Cepheus Engine campaigns. Table: Drugs Description TL Cost Medicinal Drugs 5 Cr5+ Anti -Radiation Drugs 8 Cr1,000 Panac eas 8 Cr200 Stim Drugs 8 Cr50 Combat Drug 10 Cr1,000 Fast Drug 10 Cr200 Metabolic Accelerator 10 Cr500 Medicinal Slow Drug 11 Cr500 Anagathics 15 Cr2,000 Anagathics: Slow the user’s aging process. Synthetic anagathics become possible at TL 15, but there are natural spices and other rare compounds that have comparable effects at all Technology Levels. Anagathics are illegal or heavily controlled on many worlds. One dose must be taken each month to maintain the anti -aging effect – if the character tak ing anagathics misses a dose they must make an immediate roll on the aging table as their body reacts badly to the interrupted supply. Anti -Radiation Drugs: Must be administered before or immediately after (within ten minutes) radiation exposure. They abs orb up to 100 rads per dose. A character may only use anti -rad drugs once per day – taking any more causes permanent Endurance damage of 1 D6 per dose. Combat Drug: This drug increases reaction time and improves the body’s ability to cope with trauma, aidin g the user in combat. A character using a combat drug adds +4 to his initiative total at the start of combat (or whenever the drug takes effect). He may also dodge once each round with no effect on his initiative score and reduces all damage suffered by tw o points. The drug kicks in twenty seconds (four rounds) after injection, and lasts around ten minutes. When the drug wears off, the user is fatigued. Fast Drug: Also known as 'Hibernation', this drug puts the user into a state akin to suspended animation, slowing his metabolic rate down to a ratio of 60 to 1 – a subjective day for the user is actually two months. Fast drug is normally used to prolong life support reserves or as a cheap substitute for a cryoberth. Medicinal Drugs: These medications include vaccines, antitoxins and antibiotics. They range in cost from Cr5 to 1D6x1,000 C redits, depending on the rarity and complexity of the drug. Medicinal drugs require the Medic skill to use properly – using the wrong drug can be worse than doing nothing. With a successful Medic check the correct drug can counteract most poisons or diseases, or at the very least give a positive DM towards resisting them. If the wrong drug is administered, treat it as a Difficult ( –2 DM) poison with a damage of 1 D6. Medicinal S low: A variant of the slow drug. It can only be applied safely in a medical facility where life -support and cryo -technology is available as it increases the metabolism to around thirty times normal, allowing a patient to undergo a month of healing in a sin gle day. Metabolic Accelerator: Also known as 'Slow Drug', this drug boosts the user’s reaction time to superhuman levels. A character using slow drug in combat adds +8 to his initiative total at the start of combat (or whenever the drug takes effect). He may also dodge up to twice each round with no effect on his initiative score. The drug kicks in 45 seconds (eight rounds) after ingestion or injection and lasts for around ten minutes. When the drug wears off, the user’s system crashes. He suffers 2 D6 poin ts of damage and is exhausted.

Cepheus Engine SRD 72 Samardan Pre ss Panaceas: Wide -spectrum medicinal drugs that are specifically designed not to interact harmfully. They can therefore be used on any wound or illness and are guaranteed not to make things worse. A character using panaceas may make a Medic check as if he had Medic 0 when treating an infection or disease. Stim Drugs: Removes fatigue, at a cost. A character who uses stim may remove the effects of fatigue but suffers one point of damage. If stims are used to remove fatigue again wi thout an intervening period of sleep, the character suffers two points of damage the second time, three points the third time, and so on. Explosives The Demolitions skill is used with explosives – the Effect of the Demolitions skill check multiplies the d amage, with a minimum of x1 damage for an Effect of 0 or 1. Explosives are not legally available on any world with a Law Level of 1 or greater. Table: Explosives Weapon TL Damage Radius Cost (Cr) Plastic 6 3D6 2D6 meters 200 Pocket Nuke 12 2D6 x 20 15D6 meters 20,000 TDX 12 4D6 4D6 meters 1,000 Plastic: This generic, multi -purpose plastic explosive is a favorite of military units, terrorists, demolition teams and adventurers across known space. Pocket Nuke: Hideously illegal on many worlds, the pock et nuke is actually the size of a briefcase and so is too large to fit into a grenade launcher. TDX: An advanced gravity -polarized explosive, TDX explodes only along the horizontal axis. Personal Devices Characters often possess any of a number of persona l devices, such as those described in this section.

It can be used to detect poisons or bacteria, analyse organic matter, search for life signs and classify unfamiliar organisms. The data from a bioscanner can be interpreted using the Comms or the Life Sciences skill.

The lasers use the Energy Rifle skill, do 4D6 damage each using the Ranged (rifle) range modifiers, and one, two or three may be fired at the same target with one attack action. Air/Raft: An open -topped vehicle suppo rted by anti -gravity technology. Air/rafts can even reach orbit (taking a number of hours equal to the world’s Size code) but passengers at that altitude must wear vacc suits. They are ubiquitous, remarkably reliable and flexible vehicles. ATV: An enclosed, pressurized all -terrain ground vehicle. The vehicle is capable of floating on calm water, and has a suite of built -in sensors and communications equipment (usually a laser transceiver) making it ideal for exploration. An ATV has a hardpoint for a turret, but does not come with a weapon normally.

Cepheus Engine SRD 80 Samardan Pre ss Biplane Aircraft: A primitive form of aircraft with two pair s of wings, one above the other. This vehicle can only transport 100kg of cargo. Destroyer A fast maneuverable long -endurance watercraft built for milit ary action, intended to escort larger watercraft in a fleet, convoy or battle group and defend them against smaller powerful short -range attackers. Powered by a fusion power plant, the destroyer carries deck -mounted turrets capable of firing major. Cargo capacity is limited to 40 tons, mostly used to carry ammunition. G/Carrier: A grav carrier is effectively a flying tank, and is the standard fighting vehicle of many military forces. The turret -mounted fusion gun is a vehicle -mounted version of the TL 15 FG MP and uses the same ‘serious firepower’ rules. Advanced containment systems mean that it does not leak radiation with each shot in the same way as the man -portable version. Like the air/raft, t he G/Carrier can reach orbit (taking a number of hours equal to the world’s Size code). Grav Belt: A grav belt resembles a parachute harness, and is fitted with artificial gravity modules allowing the wearer to fly. The internal battery can operate for a maximum of four hours before needing to be recharged. At TL 15, the battery can operate for 12 hours before charging. Options cannot be added to the grav belt. Grav Floater: A grav floater is a forerunner of the grav belt, a platform upon which a single person can stand and be carried along. It cannot achieve any grea t speed but can, like an air/raft, a chieve any altitude up to orbit (taking a number of hours equal to the world’s Size code). Ground Car: A ground car is a conventional wheeled automobile. Helicopter: An aircraft that derives both lift and propulsion from one or more sets of horizontally revolving overhead rotors. It is capable of moving vertically and horizontally, the direction of motion being controlled b y the pitch of the rotor blades. The helicopter can carry 500 kg of cargo. Hovercraft: A vehicle tha t travels over land or water on a cushion of air provided by a downward blast, the hovercraft is only usable on words with a Thin atmosphere or thicker. The hovercraft has 3 tons of cargo space. Motor Boat: Watercraft using hydrofoils to achieve exceptiona l speed and performance. The hold of the vehicle can accommodate 10 tons of cargo. Small Steamship: A watercraft that is propelled by a steam engine. The steamship has a cargo capacity of 50 tons. Speeder: Capable of high speed transit across a planetary s urface, the speede r is a streamlined grav vehicle with a limited cargo capacity of 100kg. This vehicle only takes an hour to reach orbit. Submersible: A watercraft designed to operate under an ocean’s surface. Submersibles are often used as transport betwe en domed cities on waterworlds and other planets with large fluid oceans. The submersible can carry 30 tons of cargo. Twin Jet Aircraft: A fixed -wing aircraft propelled by jet engines, often used to transport cargo. The hold has a cargo capacity of 5 tons. Vehicle Options With the exception of on -board computer, each of these options can only be taken once on a given vehicle. Autopilot (TL 11): An autopilot has a Model 1 computer specialized to run Intellect/1 and an Expert/1 in an appropriate skill and sp ecialty. This will be in addition to any other computers installed. An autopilot is often mandatory on cheaper commercial models. In many areas (primarily urban) they are required to be in use. Higher Law Level polities may require a slave modification to the autopilot for centralized and/or emergency traffic control. Cr3,000. Enclosed: This modification turns an open vehicle into a closed one. It costs 10% of the base cost of the vehicle, reduces Agility by 1 and top speed by 10%. Extended Life Support: A vehicle which is sealed can be equipped for extended life support, which increases the duration to 18 hours per person. Costs another 10% of the base cost of the vehicle. Heavy Armor: Increasing the armor of a vehicle by 5 adds 25% to the cost of the vehi cle.

Cepheus Engine SRD 81 Samardan Pre ss High Performance: A vehicle can be made into a high -performance vehicle, increasing its top speed by 20%. The vehicle costs 50% more. On-board Computer: Adding an on -board computer costs the same as a hand computer. Sealed: This option can be added to any closed vehicle (it is included in the ATV, AFV, G/Carrier and Speeder ). The vehicle can be sealed and provides life support for its passengers and crew for two hours per person. This option adds 20% to the cost of the vehicle. Style: Allows a vehicle to be customized to the buyer’s wishes. Costs Cr200 to Cr2,000. Weapons A small selection of the weaponry available in a Cepheus Engine campaign can be found in the tables below. The Law Level of a world will limit the availability of certain weapons. Melee Weapons A number of melee weapons are described in the Common Personal Melee Weapons table. Each column is described as follows: Cost: Price in Credits (Cr) or 1000s of Credits (KCr). TL: The minimum tech level required to manufacture such an item. Wgt: Weight in grams (g) or kilograms (kg). Range: The range category for this weapon. Damage: The damage a weapon inflicts. Type: Type of damage inflicted – (B)ludgeoning, (E)nergy, (P)iercing or (S)lashing. LL: The Law Level where the weapon first becomes illegal.

When not attached to a rifle, the bayonet performs as a dagger. Blade: A hybrid knife weapon with a heavy, flat two -edged blade nearly 300mm in length, and (often, but not always) a semi -basket handguard. Because of the bulk of the handguard, it is generally carried in a belt scabbard. Blades are as much survival tools as weapons, and are often found in emergency kits, lifeboats etc. Broadsword: The largest of the sword weapons, also calle d the two -handed sword because it requires both hands to swing. The blade is extremely heavy, two -edged, and about 1000 to 1200mm in length. The hilt is relatively simple, generally a cross -piece only, with little basketwork or protection. When carried, th e

Cepheus Engine SRD 82 Samardan Pre ss broadsword is worn in a metal scabbard attached to the belt; less frequently, the scabbard is worn on the back, and the broadsword is drawn over the shoulder. Cudgel: A basic stick used as a weapon. Easily obtained from standing trees or through the use of an unloaded long gun such as a rifle or carbine (laser weapons are too delicate to be used as cudgels). Length: 1000 to 2000mm. Cutlass: A heavy, flat -bladed, single -edged weapon featuring a full basket hilt to protect the hand. The cutlass is the stand ard shipboard blade weapon and sometimes kept in lockers on the bulkhead near important locations; when worn, a belt scabbard is used. Blade length varies from 600 to 900mm. Dagger: A small knife weapon with a flat, two -edged blade approximately 200mm in l ength. Daggers are usually carried in a belt sheath, or less frequently concealed in a boot sheath or strapped to the forearm. Daggers are usually as much a tool as a last -resort weapon of defense, and worn constantly. Each weighs 250 grams; that weight, h owever, does not count against the weight load of the character as the weapon is worn constantly and comfortably. Foil: Also known as the rapier, this weapon is a light, sword -like weapon with a pointed, edged blade 800mm in length, and a basket or cup hil t to protect the hand. Foils are worn in scabbards attached to the belt. Halberd: A two -handed pole weapon having an axe -like blade and a steel spike mounted on the end of a long shaft. Length: 2500mm. Pike: A two -handed weapon with a pointed steel or iron head on a long wooden shaft. Length: 3000 to 4000mm. Spear: A weapon with a long shaft and a pointed tip, typically of metal, used for thrusting or throwing. Length: 3000mm. Sword: The standard long -edged weapon, featuring a flat, two -edged blade. It may or may not have a basket hilt or hand protector. A scabbard to carry the sword may be attached to the belt, or to straps (or a sash) over the shoulder. Blade length may vary from 700 to 950mm. Ranged Weapons The Common Ranged Weapons table lists the range d weapons commonly available in a Cepheus Engine campaign. Each column is described as follows: Cost: Price in Credits (Cr) or 1000s of Credits (KCr). TL: The minimum tech level required to manufacture such an item. Wgt: Weight in grams (g) or kilograms (k g). RoF: Rate of Fire. The number of rounds that may be fired during a significant action in the format: Single Shot / Burst Shot / Auto matic Fire. Range: The range category for this weapon. Dmg: The damage a weapon inflicts. Type: Type of damage inflicted – (B)ludgeoning, (E)nergy, (P)iercing or (S)lashing. Recoil: Lists if the weapon has recoil when fired. LL: The Law Level where the weapon first becomes illegal. The Common Ranged Ammunition table describes the cost of ammunitions and power packs for cer tain ranged weapons. Each column is described as follows: Cost: The cost of a full magazine of standard ammunition or power pack for a weapon. TL: The minimum tech level required to manufacture such an item. Wgt: The weight of a full magazine or power pack for a weapon. Rounds: The number of rounds the weapon may fire before it must be reloaded or recharged.

Normally the rifle fires bursts of three rounds per pull of the trigg er, but may be adjusted to fire single rounds. Advanced Combat Rifle (ACR): A progressive development of the assault rifle. Assault Rifle: A lighter and less expensive version of the automatic rifle.

Cepheus Engine SRD 85 Samardan Pre ss magazine requires a reload action. Rifle ammunition may also be used in automatic rifles; rifle and auto rifle magazines are interchangeable, and weigh the same. Shotgun: The basic weapon for maximum shock effect without regard to accuracy. The shotgun has an 18mm diameter barrel and fires shells containing either six 7mm bullets, or one hundred and thirty 3mm pellets. In each case, the projectiles weigh a total of 30 grams. Velocity for the projectiles is about 350 meters per second. A cylindrical magazine containing 10 shells is inserted under the barrel and parallel to it; cartridges are then fed automatically into the shotgun for firing. Reloading consists of rep lacing the cylindrical magazine and takes two combat rounds. One shot is fired for each pull of the trigger. Magazines measure approximately 350mm long by 20mm in diameter and are quite clumsy to carry. Shotguns are equipped with a sling for carrying. Snub Pistol: A low velocity revolver designed for use shipboard and in zero -g environments. Submachinegun (SMG): A small automatic weapon designed to fire pistol ammunition. Magazines holding 30 cartridges are inserted into the weapon forward of the trigger gu ard or in the pistol grip, depending on the design. The gun fires a burst of four rounds per pull of the trigger. Replacement of an empty magazine requires one combat round. Submachinegun ammunition (but not magazines) is interchangeable with autopistol ammunition. Most submachineguns are equipped with slings for ease of carrying. Some are small enough to be carried in a shoulder or hip holster. Ranged Weapon Options The following options are generally available for certain ranged weapons. Folding Stocks: Carbines, rifles, and shotguns can be equipped with folding stocks which make it possible to reduce the overall length of the weapon by 300mm. Grenade Launcher: An underslung RAM grenade launcher can be added to any rifle. This grenade launcher has a magaz ine of one grenade, cannot fire on automatic and takes four minor actions to reload. Gyrostabilizer: Stabilizers can be added to any weapon with recoil, reducing the recoil penalty by one point (to DM-1). Intelligent Weapon: This adds a Model / 0 computer to any weapon. The TL 13 upgrade adds Model /1 to any weapon, for Cr5,000. Laser Sight: Integrated optics and laser sights give an extra +1 DM bonus to any attack that has been aimed. At TL 10, x -ray lasers and improved display technology removes the tell -tale ‘red dot’ of a vislight laser. Cr200. Laser Telescopic Sights: Electronic sights combining the capabilities of both electronic and telescopic sights. They are still rather fragile. Secure Weapon: A secure weapon requires authentication in some fashion (scanning the user’s DNA or iris patterns, entering a password, transmission of an unlocking code from a comm ) before it can be fired. Shoulder Stocks: It is possible to produce a shoulder stock which may be attached temporarily to a pistol or revolver, r esulting in a crude carbine arrangement and some greater accuracy at longer ranges. When firing a pistol or revolver equipped with such a stock, treat the weapon as ranged (shotgun). The overall length of the pistol is increased by the length of the stock, and the pistol cannot be holstered. Attaching the stock (or detaching it) requires five combat rounds. Silencer: A silencer can be added to any slug thrower with ROF 4 or less, masking the sound produced by f iring. (–4 DM to detect.) Telescopic Sights: High-quality telescopic sights for attachment to weapons, for increasing their accuracy, especially at longer ranges. A weapon equipped with such sights gains an extra +1 DM bonus to any attack that has been aimed. Telescopic sights are delicate, however, a nd may be jarred out of alignment by any violent action (such as being left untended in a moving truck, a close explosion, or being dropped) on an 8+ on 2D6. When the sights go out of adjustment, the firer will always miss.

Any laser attack made through the mist has its damage reduced by 10. Laser communications through the mist are completely blocked. The mist dissipates in 1D6x3 rounds, although high winds and other extreme weather can sharply reduce this time. Frag: The damage from fragmentation grenades decreases with distance from the blast: Table: Frag Grenade Damage by Distance Distance Damage 3 meters 5D6 6 meters 3D6 9 meters 1D6 Smoke: Smoke grenades create a thick cloud of smoke six meters in radius, centered on t he location of the grenade. This smoke imposes a –2 DM on all attacks within or through the cloud (doubled for laser weapons). Smoke dissipates in 1D6x3 rounds, although high winds and other extreme weather can sharply reduce this time.

Cepheus Engine SRD 87 Samardan Pre ss Stun: Stun weapons, such as stun grenades, are non -lethal and do not inflict normal damage. A character within six meters of a stun grenade detonation must make an Endurance check with a negative DM equal to the damage (after armor is subtracted). If this Endurance check is failed the character is knocked unconscious. If the Endurance check is successful, the character is unaffected by the weapon and the stun damage is ignored. Heavy Weapons Heavy weapons are man -portable and larger weapons that cause extreme property damage.

Those without radiation protection who are nearby when a FGMP is fired will suffer a lethal dose of radiation – each firing of an FGMP emits 2D6 x 20 rads, which will affect everyone within the immedi ate vicinity.

Cepheus Engine SRD 88 Samardan Pre ss Grenade Launcher: Grenade launchers are used to fire grenades over long distances. Grenades for a grenade launcher are not interchangeable with handheld grenades. PGMP (Plasma Gun, Man -Portable): It is so heavy and bulky that it can only be used easily by a trooper with a Strength of 12 or more – usually attained by wearing battle dress. Every point by which a user’s Strength falls short is a –1 DM on any attack rolls made with it. RAM Grenade Launcher: Rocket Assisted Multi -purpose grenade l aunchers have a longer range and are capable of firing up to three grenades with a single attack. This uses the rules for firing on full auto; unlike other automatic weapons, a RAM grenade launcher cannot fire in burst mode. It takes two minor actions to r eload a RAM grenade launcher. Grenades for a RAM grenade launcher are not interchangeable with handheld grenades. Rocket Launcher: To counteract the recoil of the weapon, a rocket launcher channels exhaust backwards in an explosive back blast. Anyone up to 1.5 meters behind a rocket launcher when it fires takes 3D6 damage from the burning gasses. Vehicle -mounted rocket launchers lose this side -effect as a vehicle is a more stable firing platform than a person. It takes three minor actions to reload a rocket launcher. The rockets presented are high -explosive models. Do not add the Effect of the attack roll to their damage but apply that damage to everything within six meters of the impact point. A rocket that misses has a 50% chance (4+ on 1D6) of detonating upon impact with the ground (6 – Effect meters away in a random direction). Otherwise it will miss completely and leave the battlefield without striking anything or detonating.

Cepheus Engine SRD 89 Samardan Pre ss CHAPTER 5: PERSONAL COMBAT Personal combat is a common means of resolving co nflicts. This chapter provides detailed rules for personal combat. Personal Combat Checklist Personal c ombat in the Cepheus Engine is cyclical. Everybody acts in turn in a regular cycle called a round. Generally, combat runs in the following way: 1. The Ref eree determines which characters are aware of their opponents at the start of the battle. If some but not all combatants are aware of their opponents, the combatants that are aware of their opponents are considered to get an automatic 12 on their initiativ e roll, giving them an Initiative of 12 + Dexterity DM. 2. Any remaining combatants roll initiative. All combatants are now ready to begin their first round of combat. 3. Combatants act in initiative order. 4. When everyone has had a turn, the combatant with the highest initiative total acts again, and steps 4 and 5 repeat until combat ends. Range Personal combat is divided into a series of range bands. These are identified in the Personal Comb at Range Bands table. Table: Personal Combat Range Bands Range Distance to Target Squares to Target Personal Less than 1.5 meters 0 (combatants are in the same square) Close 1.5 to 3 meters 1 to 2 squares Short 3 to 12 meters 3 to 8 squares Medium 12 to 50 meters 9 to 34 squares Long 51 meters to 250 meters 35 to 166 squares Very Long 251 meters to 500 meters 167 to 334 squares Distant 501 meters+ 334 squares+ The Difficulty of any attack is based on the weapon type and the range of the attack, as per the Attack Difficulties by Weapon Type table. Table: Attack Difficulties by Weapon Type Weapon Personal Close Short Medium Long Very Long Distant Close Quarters Average Difficult -- -- -- -- -- Extended Reach Difficult Average -- -- -- -- -- Thrown -- Average Difficult Difficult -- -- -- Pistol Difficult Average Average Difficult Very Difficult -- -- Rifle Very Difficult Difficult Average Average Average Difficult Very Difficult Shotgun Difficult Average Difficult Difficult Very Difficult -- -- Assault Weapon Difficult Average Average Average Difficult Very Difficult Formidable Rocket Very Difficult Difficult Difficult Average Average Difficult Very Difficult Starting Range When a combat begins, the Referee must decide the starting range that separates the groups of combatants. For co mbat in tight quarters, such as inside an office complex or starship, or within an underground tunnel system, the starting range is usually Short. The range for outdoor encounters is usually Medium, although open

Cepheus Engine SRD 90 Samardan Pre ss areas such as prairies, deserts, open roads and ocean surfaces make it easier to see at a distance, so Long or even Very Long range would not be inappropriate. Total darkness reduces starting range to Short or less. Partial darkness restricts starting range to Medium or less. Initiative If the co mbatants are all unprepared for combat, then each rolls 2 D6 and adds their Dexterity DM to determine starting Initiative. Initiative determines the order that characters act in, but it can also be spent to react to events. If some of the combatants are rea dy for combat and some are not, such as in an ambush, the prepared characters are considered to get an automatic 12 on their roll, giving them an Initiative of 12 + Dexterity DM. Characters that are aware of a group, and that group is unaware of them, may elect to avoid conflict entirely. Characters that have the Tactics skill may make a Tactics check and add the Effect of this check to the Initiative of everyone in their unit with whom they are in direct communication. The Combat Round Each combat roun d lasts around six seconds of game time. In a combat round each character gets a minor action and a significant action. Actions are taken in descending order of Initiative. If two characters have the same Initiative, the character with the highest Dexterit y goes first. If they are still tied, then characters act simultaneously. When a character acts, he takes all his actions at once. Once everyone has acted a combat round is over and a new round begins. Initiative is not re -rolled but is dynamic, and may b e adjusted up and down by actions taken during a round. Dynamic Initiative During the course of a round a character's Initiative score may be changed by reactions and hastening. Any changes affect your Initiative for one round only – either the current round if you have yet to act or the following round if you have acted already. Reactions reduce your Initiative in order to allow you to defend yourself from attacks. Hastening your action lets you act sooner but at a penalty to your roll. At the start of each combat round a character may declare that he is acting hastily. This gives him a +2 bonus to his Initiative for that round only but all his actions re ceive a –1 DM. A character can only hasten once. Minor Actions Minor actions are actions intended t o move a distance or to manipulate or move an object. You can take up to three minor actions per round, at the loss of a significant action. Aiming A character that spends a minor action aiming at a target gets a +1 DM to his next attack on the target, a s long as the character does nothing except aim until he makes his attack. A character may spend multiple actions on aiming, gaining a maximum aiming DM of +6 if he spends six minor actions on aiming. Aiming for the Ki ll Specifically aiming for a kill works exactly like regular Aiming, but does not add to the character’s DM to hit the target. Instead, the character gains a bonus of +2 to his damage equal to the number of minor actio ns he spends Aiming for the Kill. He cannot dodge, duck, or move while aiming. He also loses his Aim bonus if hit or distracted. The maximum bonus obtainable from Aiming for the Kill is +6. Changing Stance A character can change to any one of the three stances – prone, crouched or standing – as a minor action.

Cepheus Engine SRD 93 Samardan Pre ss extended action cannot do anything else but can abandon their action at any time and return to the normal Initiative order. A character who is hit by an attack while undertaking an extended action must make an 8+ roll using the skill in question with a negative DM equal to the amount of damage the attack causes (after armor). Failure indicates that this round's work does not count towards the completion of the task. Failure by six or more (an Exceptional Failure) ruins the task and the character must sta rt again. Delay A character does not have to act when his turn comes up in the Initiative order. He may act at any later point during the round, even interrupting another's actions to do so. When he acts, his Initiative is set to the count on which he a cted. If the character has not acted by the end of the round he may choose to act first in the next round, effectively giving up his actions in the previous round in exchange for an Initiative advantage. His new Initiative is set to one higher than that of the current first person in the order. When multiple characters are delaying and all wish to act first in the following round, their Initiatives are all set to the same score and they act in Dexterity order as normal. Special Considerations The followi ng are special considerations in Personal Combat. Battlefield Comms Communications technology is a vital part of the battlefield. If a character is not in communication with the rest of his unit and his commander, then he cannot benefit from Tactics or L eadership. Characters that benefitted from Tactics at the start of combat and are later cut off from their commander have their Initiative lowered by the same amount it was boosted at the start of combat. Unlike other Initiative modifications, this lasts until combat ends or communication is re -established. There are several methods of communication: • Direct: This covers hand signals and verbal communications. • Hardlinks: Hardlinks are wires or other physical connections, and cannot be jammed. • Radio: Radi o communications allow communications as long as the radio signal can get through – they can be jammed or blocked by local conditions. • Laser: Two characters with tight beam lasers are in communication as long as line of sight exists between a character an d another friendly laser -comm equipped character. • Masers: These work just like lasers, but can cut through smoke and aerosols. • Meson: Meson communicators cannot be jammed or blocked, but cannot be used while a character is moving. Battlefield Condition s Certain battlefield conditions affect ranged attacks: • Darkness: Low light gives a –1 DM to ranged attacks. Complete darkness gives a –4 DM. Light penalties can be avoided by using sensors to target instead of the naked eye. • Smoke or Fog: Smoke gives a –1 DM to ranged attacks by obscuring the target; especially thick and impenetrable smoke gives a –2 DM. These penalties are doubled for laser weapons. • Extreme Weather: Driving wind, rain, snowstorms and so forth give a –1 DM to ranged attacks from poor visibility and a –1 DM to ranged attacks from environmental interference. Sensors can be used to avoid the visibility penalty. Battlefield Sensors There are several types of sensors. • Bioscanner: Bioscanner ‘sniffers' detect airborne pathogens and hazardo us chemicals.

Cepheus Engine SRD 94 Samardan Pre ss • Infra -Red (Heat): Infra -red sensors detect warm bodies, and negate concealment from smoke and soft cover, but can be jammed by strong heat sources. • Densitometer: An outgrowth of gravitic technology, a densitometer can scan an area and plot variable densities, effectively creating a three -dimensional map of all objects. • Electromagnetic Detectors: These sensors can detect unshielded high -power electrical devices, such as gauss weapons or transmitters. • Laser -Assisted Targeting: A low -powered laser is reflected off the target, giving targeting data to the firer. • Light Intensification: Light intensification technology magnifies visible light, negating the penalties for darkness or low light. • Motion Sensors: Can detect motion within range. • Neu ral Activity Sensor (NAS): A combination of highly sensitive EM -detectors and psionic theory, NAS detectors pick up on the brain activity of living beings and classify them according to amount and complexity, giving a rough idea of the intelligence of subj ects. Blind Firing Blind firing works exactly like any other form of f iring (including automatic), but it always treats the firer as having Level 0 in that weapon’s relative skill. Additionally an extra die is thrown when firing, but before any calculations are made the highest die (or one of the highest, in case of a tie) i s removed completely. Any successful attack(s) needs to then have a die rolled to randomly choose which eligible target in the firing line is hit – whether friend or foe. Burst Fire Weapons that fire a burst of 2, 3, 4, 10, 20, or 100 rounds may improve the attacker’s odds of either hitting a target or inflict additional damage. The attacker must decide whether to spray the target, increasing the chances of scorin g a hit, or to fire a precise, grouped burst in the hope of inflicting greater damage. Either sort of burst fire is considered a significant action. Table: Burst Fire Effects Burst Size Attack DM Extra Damage 1 round +0 +0 damage 3 round burst +1 +1 po int of damage 4 round burst +1 +1D6 damage 10 round burst +2 +2D6 damage 20 round burst +3 +3D6 damage 100 round burst +4 +4D6 damage Cover Any sort of low wall, undergrowth, convenient rocks or other objects can serve as cover. Attacks made on char acters who are behind cover suffer the negative cover DM on the Cover Modifiers table below. Crouching or prone targets can claim cover one step higher on the table. If a character in full cover is crouching or prone they are impossible to hit but cannot r eturn fire. Table: Cover Modifiers Cover Cover DM 1/4 (undergrowth, small rock, corner of a building) –0 1/2 (thick forest, low wall, crate) –1 3/4 (jungle, trench, reinforced position) –2 Full (pillbox) –4

Cepheus Engine SRD 99 Samardan Pre ss the description mentions otherwise up to two people can fire into each arc from a c ivilian vehicle and one person in each arc in a military one. Open Vehicles: Open vehicles grant no cover to the passengers. Any passenger in an open vehicle can shoot (or otherwise attack) in any direction. Vehicle -Mounted Weapons Weapons mounted on v ehicles are limited in what directions they can fire. A weapon mounted in the front arc, for example, can only fire into a 90˚ area in front of the vehicle. Weapons in turrets can fire in any direction. Collisions When a vehicle collides with something els e everything takes damage. Roll 1 D6 for every 10 k ph of the vehicle's speed (round up). This is applied as damage directly to anything hit and, if the thing struck is solid enough, also to the ramming vehicle. Any unsecured passengers in a vehicle damaged in a collision take the same damage and, if possible, are thrown three meters for every 10 k ph of speed. Secured passengers (those wearing seatbelts or something similar) are not thrown anywhere and take one quarter damage. Vehicular Actions These are a ll significant actions that the driver of a vehicle can take when his turn in the initiative order arrives. Evasive Action Vehicles are not typically maneuverable enough to dodge as a reaction. Instead, the driver may declare that he is taking evasive a ction when his turn arrives. He makes a skill check (skill determined by vehicle) and the Effect acts as a –DM to all attacks against the vehicle or its passengers. The Effect also acts as a –DM to any attacks made from the vehicle as well. This lasts unti l the driver's next action. Maneuvering A driver or pilot can maneuver his vehicle without making a skill check. This allows the vehicle to avoid large or obvious obstacles, to get where it is going, to move out of one fire arc of an enemy vehicle and i nto a different one, or to change the fire arc that a single target is in. Ram Deliberately driving a vehicle into someone or something requires a significant action and a successful skill check (skill determined by vehicle). Rams are affected by dodgin g and evasive action as normal. The Referee may grant bonuses to a ram attempt or declare it automatically successful if the target is particularly large. Stunt With a significant action and a successful vehicle control check the driver or pilot of a ve hicle can do pretty much anything it is possible to do in his vehicle – stand a car up on two wheels, perform stunning aerobatics in a jet plane, or skim a speedboat over a low sandbar. A stunt can be used to put a single target into one additional fire arc for one round, to set up some other skill check using the rules for task chains, to achieve something that would normally be difficult or impossible in your vehicle, to achieve up to three maneuver actions in one go, just to show off, or anything else yo u can imagine. Weave In an environment with many obstacles, such as an inner city or tight underground caverns, a driver or pilot may choose to weave his vehicle in and around the obstacles at high speed in order to evade pursuit. The driver chooses a w eaving number, as low as one or as high as one per 20 km/h of speed (round up), and must then make a skill check (skill determined by vehicle) with the weaving number as a penalty on his roll. If he fails, he

Cepheus Engine SRD 100 Samardan Pre ss has woven into an obstacle and crashed. If he s ucceeds, any pursuers must choose a weave action on their turn and make their skill test at the same penalty with the same consequence for failure. Alternatively, they can choose to break off pursuit and either give up or try to reacquire the target later. Vehicle Damage Vehicles have a Hull value and a Structure value, which measure the vehicle's structural integrity. When Hull is reduced to 0, the vehicle starts taking damage to its internal systems. When Structure is reduced to 0, the vehicle is reduc ed to scrap. Vehicles also suffer damage to onboard systems as they take damage. To determine the effects of an attack on a vehicle, first determine how much damage the vehicle suffers as normal. Many vehicles will have one or more points of armor that re duces the damage. Consult the Vehicle Damage table to determine how many ‘hits' the vehicle suffers. Each hit is then applied to a particular location on the vehicle. Double or Triple hits count as two or three hits on the same location. Table: Vehicle Damage Damage Effect 0 or less No damage 1–3 Single Hit 4–6 Two Single Hits 7–9 Double Hit 10–12 Three Single Hits 13–15 Two Single Hits, Double Hit 16–18 Two Double Hits 19–21 Triple Hit 22–24 Triple Hit, Single Hit 25–27 Triple Hit, Double Hit 28–30 Triple Hit, Double Hit, Single Hit 31–33 Two Triple Hits For every extra three points +1 Single Hit For every extra six points +1 Double Hit Table: Vehicle Hit Location 2D6 External Hit (Vehicle) Internal Hit (Ve hicle) Robot or Drone 2 Hull Structure Hull 3 Sensors Power Plant Power Plant 4 Drive Power Plant Sensors 5 Weapon Cargo Weapon or Limb 6 Hull Structure Hull 7 Armor Passengers Armor 8 Hull Structure Hull 9 Weapon Cargo Weapon or Limb 10 Drive Computers Drive 11 Sensors Cockpit Sensors 12 Hull Cockpit Computer Hull Reduce the vehicle or drone's Hull by one. If a vehicle runs out of Hull, further Hull hits become hits on the same row of t he Internal Damage table (if a vehicle) or Structure hits (if a robot or drone).

Cepheus Engine SRD 102 Samardan Pre ss Computer First Hit: The vehicle's computer system is disabled. A drone or robot with a disabled computer system shuts down for 1 D6 rounds. Second Hit: The vehicle's computer system is destroyed. A drone or robot with no computer system is completely disabled. Further Computer hits count as Structure hits. Repairs Damage to a vehicle or drone falls into three categories – System Damage, Hull Damage, and Structure Damage. System Damage: A damaged syst em can be jury -rigged back to functioning, but it will stop functioning again after 1 D6 hours. Repairing a damaged system requires not only an Average skill check (using the appropriate skill as determined by the Referee, such as Electronics, Engineering, Gravitics, Mechanics) taking 1 –6 hours but also a source of spare parts. The spare parts can come from a scrap yard, a workshop, systems on another vehicle, or can be taken from other systems on the same vehicle. When taking spare parts from other vehicle systems, each ‘hit' of damage provides enough spare parts to make a single repair check. The Passengers and Cockpit systems cannot take hits to provide spare parts, although cybernetic parts might be able to provide enough spare material to repair minor d amage. A destroyed system costs 2 D6x10% of its original cost to repair, and cannot be repaired using spare parts. It requires a full workshop and specialist materials. Hull Damage: Hull damage can be repaired with a Mechanics check taking 1 –6 hours and c onsumes one ‘hit' of spare parts. Structure Damage: Structure damage can only be repaired in a workshop and requires 10 –60 hours per point of damage. It costs 20% of the base cost of the vehicle per point repaired. No skill check is required. Ground Force Weaponry against Starship -scale Targets Gaining a DM +4 bonus to hit anyt hing on the starship -scale, ground force weaponry must divide its damage by 50 before comparing it to a starship -scale target’s armor. Because a single weapon will, obviously, be unable to punch though armor it is possible for multiple weapons to all tar get the starship simultaneously, and the cumulative effect can inflict damage. Every additional ground weapon beyond the first can add half its damage dice to the total before dividing the total by 50 in order to calculate damage.

Cepheus Engine SRD 108 Samardan Pre ss 220% of the cash purchase price. Ship shares are treated as reducing the cash price of the ship, and so reduce the monthly cash payments. Crew Salaries All starships and space vessels need a crew of some kind. Small craft like shuttles normally just have a pilot (and usua lly a copilot). Larger ships, and especially those using Jump drive to travel between the stars, need a larger crew. At a minimum, a starship will need: Pilot: A qualified Pilot to maneuver the ship. A Pilot makes Cr6,000 per month. Navigator: Someone to c reate Jump Plots and navigate the ship. On small ships, this job is often doubled up with the Pilot’s duties. A Navigator makes Cr5,000 per month. Engineer: Someone to maintain the ship and operate the drives. Larger ships may need several engineers and technicians to back them up. A Chief Engineer makes Cr4,000 per month. Other crew positions exist: Master: A vessel’s Master, or Captain, is responsible for the vessel and the safety of everyone aboard. A Merchant who receives the Starship benefit at musteri ng-out will hold this position. Aboard a small ship, he will usually have another job, such as Pilot or Navigator. The pay due to a ship’s Master can vary. Assume a standard of Cr6,000 per month, or the salary of highest -paid job he is qualified to do. Man y merchant ship owners take a cut of the ship’s profits instead of a salary. Medic: Ships that carry passengers must have a qualified medic. All vessels should have some form of medical assistance available. A medic makes Cr2,000 a month. Purser: Commercia l ships often employ someone to look after the accounts and supplies. This is the purser’s job. It is often doubled -up with other duties. A purser is often paid a cut of the ship’s profits rather than a salary; a standard salary would be Cr3,000 per month. Gunner: Armed ships must employ gunners to operate the weapons. Salary is Cr1,000 per month. Assistant Engineers and Technicians: Technically adept people can assist the Engineer in maintaining the ship and operating her drives. Salary is Cr1000 per mont h. Cargo Handlers, Deck Hands and Security: Some ships employ personnel to carry out these duties. While not essential to the operation of the ship, these people are useful to have around. Salary is Cr1000 per month. Stewards: While anyone can be assigned to look after the passengers and cook everyone’s meals, professional stewards are useful in ensuring the passengers enjoy their trip, and thus that the ship stays in business. Salary is Cr3,000 per month. The basic living expenses of crewmembers during the ir shipboard duties are considered paid out of the ship’s overheads. Note that salaries are generalized and can vary considerably depending upon circumstances and special arrangements. Table: Crew Salaries Position Monthly Salary Ship's Master Varies Ship's Purser Varies or Cr3,000 Pilot Cr6,000 Navigator Cr5,000 Engineer Cr4,000 Steward Cr3,000 Medic Cr2,000 Gunner Cr1,000 Other Crewmember Cr1,000

These measures include internal alarms, artificial gravity control, tranq gas and the venting of atmosphere. Internal Alarms: If an alarm is tripped (hull breach, fire, door being forced open, alarm button pressed) it will alert the crew. The location of the alarm will be shown on computer displays. The average passenger ship has several crew trained in combat; m ilitary ships will carry marines. Some vessels will even have security robots who respond automatically to alarms. Artificial Gravity Control: It is possible to alter the artificial gravity on board. Reducing gravity to zero will limit actions to the level of a character’s Zero -G skill. Gravity can also safely be increased up to 3G. Tranq Gas: Some ships carry tranq gas canisters in the air vents, which can be released automatically. These flood a compartment with gas that forces an Endurance check each ro und, with a –1 DM per previous check. Any character who fails the Endurance check is knocked unconscious. Venting Atmosphere: If a compartment is connected to an airlock, then the air can be vented from that area. Characters in that area must make a Stre ngth check to hang on and will also begin to suffocate. Internal doors on a ship are airtight, so portions of the ship can be selectively vented, dependent on the ship's floor plan and the relative positions of airlocks. Planetary Travel on Other Worlds On-planet, and in civilized areas, regular services may be available for a few credits, allowing characters to ride to their destination aboard anything from a rickshaw to a maglev bullet train. In the course of their adventures, characters may ride aboard steam ships, dirigibles, submersibles, grav speeders or atop living mounts. Costs are fairly negligible for such travel. Assume a basic cost of 1 D6X5 Credits per day of travel. If the characters wish to use a vehicle of their own, this cost is not necessar y. However, a suitable vehicle must be available. Characters and the Law In each of the situations listed in the Potential Law Enforcement Encounters table, roll 2 D6 and add the listed modifiers. If the total is lower than the planet's Law Level, the char acters are investigated or challenged by agents of planetary law enforcement. Table: Potential Law Enforcement Encounters Situation DM Response First approach to a planet +0 Check Offworlders wandering the streets of a city (once per day) +0 Check Offw orlders acting suspiciously –1 Check Bar fight –1 Combat Shots fired –2 Combat Breaking and entering –2 Investigate Firefight involving a rmor ed characters and military weapons –4 Combat Murder and carnage –4 Investigate

Cepheus Engine SRD 114 Samardan Pre ss Check means that the charac ters' travel documents and identities are checked, either by a police officer or guard, or electronically by querying the characters' comms. A successful Admin or Streetwise roll can allay suspicion, but if this check is failed, the planetary authorities m ove on to Investigate. Investigate means that a detective or bureaucrat probes deeper into the characters' backgrounds. If the characters have a ship, it will be searched. They may be followed, or have their communications tapped. They may also be questio ned closely. Finally, Combat means that the police show up ready for a fight. Their response will generally be proportional to the threat posed by the player characters; if the characters are just making trouble in a bar, then most police forces will just use batons, tranq gas and other non -lethal weapons. On the other hand, if the characters are in Battle Dress and firing PGMPs at the palace of the planetary governor, then the police will show up with the best weapons and armor available at the planet's T L (or even a few levels higher). Arrests and Sentencing Characters arrested for a crime will face punishment, determined by rolling 2 D6+DMs on the Sentencing table. For crimes involving smuggling banned goods, the DM is equal to the difference between th e planet's Law Level and the banned goods in question. Other crimes have a set DM, per the Sentencing Modifiers by Crime table. Table: Sentencing Modifiers by Crime Crime DM Assault Law Level –5 Destruction of Property Law Level –3 False Identity Law L evel –2 Manslaughter Law Level –1 Murder Law Level +0 A character with the Advocate skill may attempt to reduce the severity of sentencing by making a check. If successful, reduce the Sentencing DM by the Effect of the check. Table: Sentencing Result Sentence 0 or less Dismissed or trivial punishment 1–2 Fine of 1 D6x1,000 Credits 3–4 Fine of 2 D6x5,000 Credits 5–6 Exile or a fine of 2 D6x10,000 Credits 7–8 Imprisonment for 1 D6 months or exile or fine of 2 D6x20,000 Credits 9–10 Imprisonment for 1 D6 years or exile 11–12 Imprisonment for 2 D6 years or exile 13–14 Life imprisonment 15+ Death A result of Exile means that the character must leave the planet immediately and never return. Fines for smuggling goods are per ton of goods seized – gun run ning can be an extremely risky proposition.

Cepheus Engine SRD 115 Samardan Pre ss CHAPTER 7: TRADE AND COMMERCE As outlined under Starship Revenues in Chapter 6: Off -World Travel, a vessel can easily haul cargo for a flat rate, without having to engage in speculative trading. However, for those merchants willing to take the risk, speculative trading can prove to be a very profitable enterprise. This chapter provides a simple speculative trade system for use in Cepheus Engine campaigns, for those interested in such pursuits. Speculative Tr ade Checklist Speculative trading follows a basic procedure. The following checklist outlines the various steps in the speculative trade procedure. 1. Find a supplier 2. Determine goods available 3. Determine purchase price 4. Take goods to new world or market 5. Find a buyer 6. Determine sales price Find a Supplier The first step in the process is simple: find a supplier with something to sell. Characters can search for multiple suppliers, but there is a –1 DM per previous attempt on a planet in a given month. Finding a supplier: Broker, Education or Social Standing, 1 D6 days, Average (+0). Finding a black market supplier: (Illegal goods only) Streetwise, Education or Social Standing, 1 D6 days, Average (+0). Finding an online supplier: (Worlds with TL 8+ only) Computers, Education, 1 D6 hours, Average (+0). The size of the Starport provides a bonus to finding a supplier. Class A starports give a +6 DM, class B starports give a +4 DM and class C starports give a +2 DM. Determine Goods Available Goods are divided into two c ategories of goods – Common and Trade Goods. Common Goods can be purchased on any world. Trade Goods can usually only be found on a world with a matching trade code. The amount of each type of goods available is limited – the tons column on the Trade Goods table determines how many tons of a given type of goods is available for purchase. A given supplier has all Common Goods available and 1 D6 randomly determined goods. Roll D66 on the table to determine the goods available, ignoring results 61 –65 unless de aling with a black market supplier. If you roll the same type of goods multiple times, then the supplier has extra amounts of those goods available. Some goods are illegal, and can be purchased only through a black market supplier. A black market supplier has whatever illegal goods match his world’s trade code, as well as any randomly rolled illegal goods. Other goods may be legal on some worlds, but not legal on others (such as personal weapons and armor, which might be restricted on a world with a high l aw level). The Referee should adjudicate such situations as they occur.

Cepheus Engine SRD 119 Samardan Pre ss CHAPTER 8: SHIP DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION Space ships are the backbone of any starfaring campaign. This chapter provides rules for the design and constr uction of such vessels for use in Cepheus Engine campaigns. Any class A starport has a shipyard which can build any kind of ship, including a starship with Jump drives; any class B starport can build small craft and ships which do not have Jump drives. Standard Designs vs. New Designs An interstellar economy provides an excellent opportunity for the use of standardized and modular designs. Components can be crafted on different worlds, taking advantage of available resources, and then put together to creat e a final product. Shipyards take advantage of modular components and standardized designs to reduce costs in production, which leads to a 10% discount on vessels constructed using common designs, such as those described in Chapter 9: Common Vessels. The R eferee may designate other ship designs as standard designs, as befits their universe. Fuel and weapon ammunition are not covered by the standard design discount. New and unique ship designs cannot take advantage of standardized and modular design. These s hips must be designed by a naval architect, who creates detailed design plans based on a set of specifications provided by their client. Such plans take a month to create, and costs approximately 1% of the final cost of the vessel. Ship Design Checklist Space ship design follows a very methodical process in the Cepheus Engine rules. 1. Choose a Ship Hull a. Determine hull configuration b. Install armor (optional) 2. Choose maneuver drive (optional, but highly recommended) 3. Choose jump drive (optional) 4. Choose power plan t 5. Determine fuel requirements 6. Determine bridge 7. Choose ship’s computer a. Choose computer software 8. Choose ship’s electronics 9. Determine number of required crew a. Choose staterooms and low berths 10. Determine additional features (optional) 11. Determine turrets, bays or screens (optional) a. Determine weapons (optional) 12. Allocate remaining space to cargo 13. Calculate final cost and construction time a. Apply standard design discount of 10% (optional) A Note on System Redundancy Ship systems take damage for a variety of reasons, be coming disabled or destroyed as damage accumulates. To counter the loss of vital ship systems, some ship designers install multiple versions of certain components. These redundant systems remain inactive until the original system is disabled, with the exce ption of ship weaponry. When all redundant systems have been disabled, any further damage begins to destroy them, beginning with the primary system.

Cepheus Engine SRD 120 Samardan Pre ss Displacement Tons Hulls and other ship components are designated by their displacement volume. Displacem ent volume is measured in the volume of space that is displaced by one metric ton of hydrogen, referred to in this design sequence as displacement tons or simply tons. A metric ton of hydrogen measures approximately 13.5 cubic meters, which is rounded to 14 cubic meters for ease of calculations. When drawing floor plans or maps of ships, each square measuring 1.5 meters by 1.5 meters, to a height of 3m up from the floor, represents half a ton. Ship Hull The ship’s hull is the shell in which all other comp onents are placed. A ship’s construction time is based on its hull size, as outlined on the Ship Hull table. Table: Ship Hull by Displacement Hull Hull Code Price (MCr) Construction Time ( weeks ) 100 tons 1 2 36 200 tons 2 8 44 300 tons 3 12 52 400 ton s 4 16 60 500 tons 5 32 68 600 tons 6 48 76 700 tons 7 64 84 800 tons 8 80 92 900 tons 9 90 100 1,000 tons A 100 108 1,200 tons C 120 124 1,400 tons E 140 140 1,600 tons G 160 156 1,800 tons J 180 172 2,000 tons L 200 188 3,000 tons M 300 268 4,000 tons N 400 348 5,000 tons P 500 428 Ship Configuration A ship may have any of three configurations – standard (a wedge, cone, sphere or cylinder), streamlined (a wing, disc or other lifting body allowing it to enter the atmosphere easily) or dist ributed (made up of several sections, and incapable of entering an atmosphere or maintaining its shape under gravity). Standard: A standard -hull ship may still enter atmosphere but is very ungainly and ponderous, capable only of making a controlled glide to the surface. Getting it back into space requires an elaborate launch setup and considerable expense. A standard -hull ship may have scoops for gathering fuel from a gas giant but the process will be much more difficult and less efficient. Larger ships of this type wil l often carry a specialized sub -craft to perform the actual atmospheric skimming. Streamlined: Streamlining a ship increases the cost of the hull by 10%. This streamlining includes fuel scoops which allow the skimming of unrefined fuel from gas giants or the gathering of water from open lakes or oceans. Streamlining may not be retrofitted; it must be included at the time of construction. Distributed: A distributed ship reduces the cost of its hull by 10%. It is completely non -aerodynamic and if it enters an atmosphere or strong gravity it will fall to the surface of the planet. It cannot mount fuel scoops.

Cepheus Engine SRD 121 Samardan Pre ss Table: Ship Configuration Configuration Hull Cost Modifier Notes Distributed x0.9 Cannot mount fuel scoops. Atmospheric operations suffer -4 DM (failed checks inflict 2 D6 damage). Standard x1.0 Atmospheric operations suffer a -2 DM. Streamlined x1.1 Includes fuel scoops. Ship Armor Armor is added in 5% increments of the ship’s tonnage. An armored ship decreases radiation exposure from space phenomena by 400 rads. (This does not apply to mes on attacks and nuclear missiles, which bypass the armor or breach the hull to deliver their radiation hits.) Table: Ship Armor by Type Armor Type TL Protection Cost Titanium Steel 7 2 per 5%, minimu m 1 ton 5% of base hull Crystaliron 10 4 per 5%, minimum 1 ton 20% of base hull Bonded Superdense 14 6 per 5%, minimum 1 ton 50% of base hull For example, a heavily a rmor ed warship might take Bonded Superdense a rmor twice. This would take up 10% of the hull’s volume and cost 100% of the base cost of the hull, but give 12 points of a rmor. Ship Armor Options The following are options that can be added to a ship’s armor. Reflec (TL 10): Reflec coating on the hull increases the ship’s a rmor against lasers by 3. Adding Reflec costs MCr 0.1 per ton of hull and can only be added once. Self-Sealing (TL 9): A self -sealing hull automatically repairs minor breaches such as micrometeoroid impacts, and prevents hull hits from leading to explosive decompression. It costs MCr0.01 per ton of hull. Stealth (TL 11): A stealth coating absorbs radar and lidar beams, and also disguises heat emissions. This gives a – 4 DM on any Comms rolls to detect or lock onto the ship. Adding Stealth costs MCr0.1 per ton of hull, and can only be added once. Hull and Structure Initial damage is applied to the Hull; once the Hull is breached, further damage goes to the Structure. When all Structure Points have been lost, the ship has been smashed to pieces. A ship has one Hull Point per 50 tons of displacement (rounded down) and one Structure Point per 50 tons of displacement (rounded up). Ship Sections Most vessels are divided into two primary sections. The Engineering Section The Engineering section contains the drives and power plant necessary for proper operation and movement. The Main Compartment The ship’s main compartment contains all non -drive features of the ship, including the bridge, ship’s computer, the staterooms, the low passage berths, the cargo hold and other items.

Cepheus Engine SRD 125 Samardan Pre ss Ship Computer The ship computer is identified by its model number; the computer table indicates det ails of price, capacity, and tech level available. Table: Ship Computer Models Computer TL Rating Cost Model 1 7 5 Cr30,000 Model 2 9 10 Cr160,000 Model 3 11 15 MCr2 Model 4 12 20 MCr5 Model 5 13 25 MCr10 Model 6 14 30 MCr20 Model 7 15 35 MCr30 Ship Computer Options The following options are available for ship’s computers. Jump Control Specialization (bis): A computer’s rating can be increased by 5 for the purposes of running Jump Control programs only. This increases the computer’s cost by 50%. Hardened Systems (fib): A computer and its connections can be hardened against attack by electromagnetic pulse weapons. A hardened system is immune to EMP, but costs 50% more. Both options can be applied to the same computer by doubling its cost (+100%). Ship Software Ship computers run highly specialized software packages designed to support numerous functions, such as managing the Jump drive, evading incoming fire, controlling ship’s weapons and executing automatic repairs. Ship’s computers automatically provide the means for basic control of the vessel, as well as extensive l ibrary data on numerous topics and a basic level of security (Security/0).

Cepheus Engine SRD 126 Samardan Pre ss Table: Ship Software Program TL Rating Cost (MCr) Notes Auto -Repair 10+ 10 per repair attempt 5 per repa ir attempt Computer may attempt one repair per turn, or give a DM+1 to an attempt; at TL 12, can purchase an additional repair attempt (or DM+1) for twice the Rating and Cost. Evade 9+ 5 + 5 per DM-1 1 per DM -1 Imposes DM -1 on incoming fire; every two TLs higher, can purchase an addition DM -1, to a maximum of DM -3 at TL 13. Fire Control 9+ 5 per weapon 2 per weapon Ship’s computer may fire one weapon; for each additional weapon, TL is increased by 1 ( the ship can fire up to 2 weapons at TL 10, 3 at TL 11, and so on). The ship’s computer may also sacrifice controlling a weapon to give a DM+1 from computer targeting on another attack, whether that weapon is controlled by the ship’s computer or by an actual gunner. Maximum of five weapons may be controlled by this program. Jump Control 9+ 5 per Jn 0.1xJn Governs Jump drives up to a given Jump number (Jn); TL is the same as the TL required for a given Jump number. Jump Course Tape 9+ 1 per Jn 0.001xJn Provides jump plot from one specific world to a specific destination system. Price based on number of parsecs between worlds; TL is the same as the TL required for a given Jump number needed to cover that Jump. Ship Electronics A ship comes with a basic communications, sensor and emissions -control electronics s uite, but more advanced systems can be installed. The Dice Modifier applies to jamming and counter -jamming attempts.

It can be active or passive. If a ship is using active sensors, it is easier to detect (+2 DM to Comms checks) but detects more about its surroundings. Jammers can jam or counter -jam radio communications and sensor locks. Densitometers can determ ine the internal structure and makeup of an object. Neural Activity Sensor detects neural activity and intelligence. Ship Crew All vessels require a crew t o operate and maintain the ship. Small independently -owned vessels tend to operate with a minimum of crew, while corporate and military vessels maintain a full complement.

Cepheus Engine SRD 127 Samardan Pre ss Table: Ship Crew Requirements Position Minimum Full Complement Command None One commanding officer or Captain, one executive officer, three administrative personnel (for ships over 1,000 tons) Pilot One Three (one per 8 -hour shift) Navigator One (optional with computer software ) One Engineer One One per 35 tons of drives and power plant Sensors Operator None One Medic None One per 120 passengers and crew Steward None One per four high passe ngers or ten middle passengers (assumes Steward -1) Turret Gunner One per turret weapon One per turret weapon Bay Gunner One per bay weapon Two per bay weapon Screen Operator One per screen device Four per screen device Chief Security Officer None One (optional) Flight Crew None One per smallcraft or vehicle carried in hangars or launch tubes, plus one support crew per three vehicles or vessels Marine None On ships over 1,000 tons, may have up to 30 per 1,000 tons Other None As needed (i.e. medical staff, scientists, surveyors, etc.) Staterooms Each stateroom is sufficient for one person, displaces 4 tons, and costs Cr500,000. No stateroom can contain more than two persons, such as for middle passengers, as it would strain the ship’s li fe support equipment. The tonnage and cost of the staterooms includes the life support systems needed to keep the crew alive. Low Passage Berths One low passage berth carries one low passenger, costs Cr50,000, and displaces one -half ton. Emergency low b erths are also available; they will not carry passengers, but can be used for survival. Each costs Cr100,000 and displaces one ton. Each holds four persons. Barracks A barracks takes up 2 tons per marine, and costs MCr 0.1 per marine. Barracks can only be used to accommodate troops intended for boarding or assault operations. Troops accommodated in barracks cannot be used to reduce the number of service crew embarked. Additional Ship Components The following are examples of additional ship components that might prove useful for certain ship designs. Armory Ships carrying a large number of marines or soldiers can benefit from an armory, a specialized weapons store. An armory can only be accessed by those with the correct codes (usually the ship’s senior off icers and security team) and contains a wide variety of weapons. In game terms, an armory has enough snub pistols for the crew, enough accelerator or gauss rifles for any marines, and a selection of other military equipment like grenades,

Cepheus Engine SRD 129 Samardan Pre ss Luxuries Luxuries cost Cr100,000 per ton, and make life on board ship more pleasant. Each ton of luxuries counts as one level of the Steward skill for the purposes of carrying passengers, and therefore allows a ship to carry middle and high passage passengers without carrying a trained steward on board. Ship’s Locker Every ship has a ship’s locker. Typical equipment carried aboard will include protective clothing, vacc suits, weapons such as shotguns or pistols, ammuni tion, compasses and survival aids, and portable shelters. The contents of the locker are defined only when they need to be but always contains vacc suits and other useful items. The ship’s locker is usually protected by a biometric lock keyed to the ship’s officers. Vault A vault is a special armored chamber in the heart of a spacecraft, designed to survive attacks that would annihilate the rest of the ship. A vault has another four Hull and Structure points that only come into play when the ship housing t he vault is destroyed. A vault can contain cargo, staterooms or any other internal components equivalent up to 6 tons. A vault requires 12 tons of space and costs MCr6. Vehicle and Drone Hang ar The tonnage and cost outlined in the Hangar Cost and Tonnage for Vehicles and Drones table covers full-scale hangar space, which allows for repairs and maintenance of small craft when they are back on the ship. The hangar includes spare parts and specialized testing and repair equipment for the stored craft. It does not include the cost of the vehicles or drones. A custom hangar takes up tonnage equal to the tonnage of the vehicle to be stored, plus 30% and costs MCr0.2 per ton. Air/Raft, ATV: These are vehicles, stored in or on the ship. Escape Pods: This covers th e installation of rescue bubbles and other escape pods for the entire crew. Life Boat, Ship’s Boat, Shuttle, Pinnace, Cutter: These are all small craft, hangered either in or on the ship’s hull. Mining Drones: Mining drones allow a ship to mine asteroids. Each set of mining drones takes up ten tons, and allows the ship to process 1 D6x10 tons of asteroid per working day. The tonnage allocated includes ore handling machinery, allowing the ship to take on ore and transfer it to the cargo bay. Probe Drones: Probe drones are for surveying planetary surfaces. Each ton of probe drones contains five drones. Probe drones can be dropped from orbit in disposable entry shells but must be recovered manually. Probe drones are also capable of surveying orbiting satellites, derelicts and other space debris. They can also be used as communications relays. Repair Drones: Carrying repair drones allows a ship to make battlefield repairs with the AutoRepair software or when managed by a character with Mechanic or Engineer skill s. Repair drones have the same statistics as repair robots only without an Intellect program. For more information on repair robots, see Robots and Drones in Chapter 4: Equipment.

A weapon system may include multiple weapons – for example, a triple turret contains three lasers, missile launchers, sandcast ers or some combination of three weapons. Turrets One turret may be attached to each hardpoint on the ship. If a turret is installed, then one ton of space must be allocated to fire control systems: Table: Turret Displacement and Cost Weapon TL Tons Cost (MCr ) Single Turret 7 1 0.2 Double Turret 8 1 0.5 Triple Turret 9 1 1 Pop-Up Turret 10 2 +1 Fixed Mounting - 0 x 0.5 Single, Double and Triple turrets can hold one, two or three weapons. Pop-Up is a quality that can be applied to any type of turr et – the turret is concealed in a pod or recess on the hull, and is detectable only when deployed. A ship with all its weapons in pop -up turrets looks unarmed to a casual sensor scan. Fixed Mounting weapons cannot move, are limited to firing in one directi on (normally straight ahead), and are found mainly on fighters. A fixed mounting costs half as much as a turret of the same type, so a single fixed mounting costs MCr 0.1, a double fixed mounting costs MCr 0.25, and a triple fixed mounting costs MCr 0.5.

Cepheus Engine SRD 131 Samardan Pre ss Missile racks launch self -propelled weapons designed to explode on impact. Pulse lasers fire short, rapid bursts of intense energy. Pulse lasers are notoriously inaccurate and suffer a DM -2 on all attack rolls. Sandcasters reduces the damage from a beam weapon by 1 D6. Sandcasters require ammunition. Twenty sandcaster barrels take up one ton of space, can be manufactured at TL5, and cost Cr10,000. Particle beams fire a high -energy beam of subatomic particles. The beam’s impact disru pts the molecular structure of the target, causing a radiation crew hit in addition to normal damage. Beam lasers fire a continuous stream of intense energy. No launcher includes ammunition in its purchase cost. Missiles, torpedoes and so forth must be pur chased separately. Missiles Missiles are weapons that are self -propelled or directed by remote control, carrying a conventional or nuclear explosive. They may be fired from missile racks mounted in turrets or from bay -mounted missile banks. Twelve missile s take up one ton of space. Missiles are capable of T hrust 10, but have a limited endurance of 60 minutes (roughly 4 turns) before running out of fuel. There are three common types of missiles: Standard, Smart and Nuclear. Table: Missile Types Missile Type TL Damage Cost per Missile Notes Nuclear 6 2D6+ 1 radiation hit Cr3,750 Radiation hit suffers a –DM equal to the ship's armor Standard 6 1D6 Cr1,250 Smart 8 1D6 Cr2,500 Attack roll is always 8+, and may attack every turn if they miss until they are d estroyed, jammed or run out of fuel Bays Bay weapons are much larger than turrets, and take up 50 tons of space and one hard point, as well as one ton of space for fire control.

Particle beam bays fire a larger and more powerful beam of subatomic particles than particle beam turret weapons. Meson weapons are unaffected by armor, as the blast only becomes harmful after it has already passed through the hull. Meson guns also inflict an automatic radiation hit on the cr ew of any target struck. Fusing weapons fire a stream of hydrogen particles that are undergoing a fusion reaction. Screens Screens are defensive systems that protect against specific attacks.

Nuclear dampers inhibit fusion reactions, reducing the damage from fusion weapons and nuclear missiles by 2D6 when affected. Universal Ship Description Format After a ship design has been created, it must be presented in a format that allows players to use the information within the game. The Cepheus Engine describes ship designs using a universal ship description format, which is essentially a paragraph of text laid out in the following manner. Examples can be found in Chapter 9: Common Vessels. [Ship's Tech Level] [Ship Descriptive Name] Using a [Ship Hull Displacement] -ton hull ([Hull Damage Value] Hull, [Structure Damage Value] Structure,), the [Ship Descriptive Name] is [General Description of Ship's Function]. It mounts jump drive [Jump Drive Code], maneuver drive [Maneuver Drive Code], and power plant [Power Plant Code], giving a performance of Jump - [Jump Number] and [Thrust Number] -G acceleration. Fuel tankage of [Fuel Tonnage] tons supports the power plant for [Weeks of Power] and [Number of Jumps] jump -[Jump Number]. [Any additional f uel usage notes.] Adjacent to the bridge is a computer Model [Computer Number, followed by a slash and bis or fib options noted, if purchased]. The ship is equipped with [Sensors Type] sensors ([Sensors DM].) There are [Number of Staterooms] staterooms and [Number of Low Berths] low berths. The ship has [Number of Hardpoints] hardpoints and [Fire Control Tonnage] tons allocated for fire control. Installed on the hardpoints are [Describe number and type of turrets, and any weapon systems that have been insta lled, if any. Also note any ammunition carried for missiles and sandcasters.] This ship has [Number of Screens Installed] screens: [Describe number and type of screens]. There are [Number of Small Craft Hangers] small craft hangars, [Describe number and co ntents of each hangar]. Cargo capacity is [Cargo Tonnage] tons. The hull is [Hull Configuration], and is armored with [Armor Type] ([Armor Rating] points.) [Note any Ship's Armor options that have been installed.] Special features include [List additional components here, included fuel processors and fuel scoops]. The ship requires a crew of [Crew Total]: [List crew positions]. The ship can carry up to [Double the Number of Non -Crew Staterooms] additional passengers at double occupancy and [Number of Low Be rths] low passengers. The ship costs MCr[Cost of Ship] (including discounts and fees) and takes [Construction Time] weeks to build. Alternative Star Drives In classic era science -fiction games such as the Cepheus Engine, the only form of faster -than -light movement is typically the Jump drive, which always takes one week to travel a number of parsecs equal to its Jump rating and consumes a vast amount of fuel. If the Referee wishes to model other science fiction settings with their own forms of “star drive ”, the classic Jump drive rules may not be entirely appropriate. The alternative drives below use all the same rules as the Jump drive (mass, fuel, power consumption, range) unless otherwise stated.

Cepheus Engine SRD 134 Samardan Pre ss fuel costs Cr1,000,000 per ton. Fission plants use the same amount of fuel in a year that standard fusion power plants require for two weeks. Antimatter Power Plants Antimatter power plants work by anni hilating small amounts of hydrogen and anti -hydrogen. No tonnage needs to be allocated to fuel, but the plant must be refueled once per month, at a cost of Cr5,000 per ton of drive. Small Craft Design Small craft design follows the rules for standard ship design, with the following changes. Small Craft Ship Hull Small craft use the Small Craft Ship Hull by Displacement table below. The cost of streamlining and distributed configurations are calculated as per standard ship design rules.

Instead, a cockpit or control cabin serves the same function. A cockpit is more cramped, but takes up less tonnage. The cost for a cabin or cockpit is the same – MCr 0.1 per 20 tons of ship. Additional cabin space costs MCr 0.05 per ton. Cockpits and control cabins come equippe d with a basic communications, sensor and emissions -control electronics suite. More advanced systems can be installed per the standard ship design rules.

Airlo cks take up one ton each and cost MCr0.2. If a craft does not have an airlock, then the crew cannot leave the craft except when it is landed or in a pressurized landing bay without opening the ship up to vacuum.

Cepheus Engine SRD 138 Samardan Pre ss Small Craft Crew All small craft of 50 tons or under require a minimum crew of one to operate and maintain the ship. Small craft larger than 50 tons require a minimum crew of two. Small Craft Armaments A small craft has one hardpoint, despite being less than 100 tons. Small craft follow the standa rd ship design rules regarding armaments, with some exceptions. Meson, particle beam and fusion bays cannot be fitted. The armaments allowed to a small craft are restricted by its power plant type. It may only equip up to the number of lasers and particle weapons allowed by the vessel’s power plant, as shown in the Maximum Energy Weapons by Power Plant table. The number of missile launchers or projectile weapons is not limited by the power plant letter.

Cepheus Engine SRD 139 Samardan Pre ss CHAPTER 9: COMMON VESSELS This section describes some of the starships and other vessels that can be commonly encountered in Cepheus Engine campaigns. These are not the only types of vessels that exist, and creative Referees are encouraged to integrate ships of their own creation or from other sources as they see fit.

This small craft does not come with weapons pre -installed. Cargo capacity is 67.4 tons. The hull is Standa rd, and no additional armor has been installed. There are no special features on this ship. This ship requires a crew of two: Two pilots. The ship

Cepheus Engine SRD 147 Samardan Pre ss can carry one additional passenger in the control cabin. The ship costs MCr25.587 (including discounts and f ees) and takes 35 weeks to build.

Cepheus Engine SRD 148 Samardan Pre ss CHAPTER 10: SPACE COMBAT Space combat is a staple in classic science fiction, and the Cepheus Engine has rules to cover it. This chapter details the basics for space combat. These rules for vehicle and starship combat p resented here are designed to allow for more roleplaying and involvement of the characters. Movement and maneuvering are abstracted to allow for cinematic battles as vessels attempt to maneuver into a position of pursuit and advantage against their opponen ts, or frantically try to shake pursuit. Range is similarly abstracted, needing only to note whether the range for all vessels involved for each round is Close, Short, Medium, Long, Very Long, or Extreme. Space Combat Checklist Like personal combat, spa ce combat in the Cepheus Engine is cyclical. Everybody acts in turn in a regular cycle called a turn. Each turn in space combat lasts one kilosecond. Generally, space combat runs in the following way: 1. The Referee determines the range at which the encounter begins. 2. All crew members are assigned to a position on board their vessel. 3. The Referee determines which characters are aware of their opponents at the start of the battle. If some but not all vessel s are aware of their opponents, the vessel s that are awar e of their opponents are considered to get an automatic 12 on their initiative roll, giving them an Initiative of 12 + Dexterity DM. 4. Any remaining vessel s roll initiative. All vessel s are now ready to begin their first turn of combat. 5. All vessels act in i nitiative order. a. At the start of each combat turn, a Captain may declare that their crew is acting hastily. b. The crew members of the vessel resolve their actions. c. After every crew member has completed their actions, any damage is resolved if the vessel’s we apon systems hit enemy ships. 6. When every vessel has had a turn, the combatant with the highest initiative total acts again, and Step 5 repeat s until combat ends. Range in Space Combat If two vessels randomly encounter each other while travelling through the depths of space, far from any other objects or vessels, the encounter will begin at Very Long range. More often, ships engage near a planet, where the range is Short or Medium.

Cepheus Engine SRD 150 Samardan Pre ss  A ship equipped with repair drones and Auto -Repair software acts as damage control.  A ship running an Intellect program and Expert Pilot can be the pilot.  A ship equipped with repair drones and running an Intellect program and Expert Engineer can be a drive engineer. Initiative Each ship in an engagement rolls 2 D6 to determine their starting Initiative score. The ship with a greater Thrust score gains a +1 DM to its roll. The Captai n of each vessel (or each fleet, if more than one ship is involved on each side) may a Tactics check. The Effect is added to the Initiative of the vessel (or fleet). The Space Combat Turn Each turn in space combat lasts around one kilosecond (1,000 secon ds) of game time. In a combat turn, vessels have individual Initiative. Actions are taken in descending order of Initiative. If two vessels have the same Initiative, the vessel with the highest Thrust goes first. If they are still tied, then vessels act si multaneously. When a vessel acts, the crew members of the vessel take all of their actions at once. Each crew member gets a minor action and a significant action. Once everyone has acted a combat turn is over and a new turn begins. Initiative is not re -rolled but is dynamic, and may be adjusted up and down by actions taken during a turn. Note on Personal Actions As a space combat turn represents over 150 personal combat rounds, it stands to reason that crew members may engage in a lot of personal actions over the course of a single combat turn. Much of this is abstracted into the various space combat actions. Most personal actions have minimal impact on space combat. For crew members that do want to pursue a personal action during space combat, such as us e a psionic ability, these actions count as minor actions on the space combat scale. This glosses over the remainder of the character's time during the combat turn, and highlights the primary acts that a character might want to pursue without taking away f rom the rest of the space combat.

Each crew member can take up to three minor actions per turn, at the loss of a significant action. Adjust Speed The pilot may increase or decrease the vessel's speed up to an amount equal to its Thrust. This requires no skill check. Change Positions Crew members changes crew positions, and are now considered to be manning their new position rather than their previous one. Maintain Course The pilot keeps the vessel on its current course and heading, remaining at the current speed. This requires no skill check. Personal Action A crew member may pursue any personal action that generally takes less than a minute. Miscellaneous The Referee may permit a character to perform a skill check or other action as a minor action if the use of the skill does not require the character's full attention or complex physical actions. Significant Actions Significant actions are intended to do something within about 3 seconds. You can perform a single significant action per turn, or forego it to perform a total of three minor actions. Take Minor Actions A character can take two minor actions instead of a significant action.

Cepheus Engine SRD 152 Samardan Pre ss Attack A gunner may attack any target within the range of the weapon system they are manning. The gunner attacks by making a T urret Weapons or Bay Weapons skill check roll at a Difficulty determined by range, adding any Computer Targeting, Sensor Targeting, or other modifiers in effect this round for his vessel. The enemy ship may react by dodging, point defense or triggering scr eens (see Reactions). A gunner may fire any or all of the weapons in his turret or bay but each turret or bay may only fire once per round. If the attack is successful it will inflict damage. Damage is resolved after all attacks have been made in a vessel’ s turn. Missiles do not impact in the same round they are launched; their damage is resolved in the combat turn that they impact their target. Avoid Collision When a vessel is moving at Short or Close range through a debris field, traffic, an asteroid bel t, a planetary ring, or similar situation where there is a reasonable chance of collision with another object, the pilot must make an Avoid Collision check each turn. A collision inflicts 1D6 damage for every point of the vessel’s current speed. Table: Co llision Avoidance Situation Difficulty Traffic (5 or more vessels within Short range), debris Average (+0) Asteroid field, light density Difficult ( -2) Asteroid field, average density Very Difficult ( -4) Asteroid field, heavy density Formidable ( -6) Significant speed difference between ship and debris DM -2 Boarding Action If two ships are Adjacent or docked, then a boarding action can be attempted. If the ships are docked, then the attackers may cross over safely via airlocks. If the ships are me rely adjacent, then the attackers must use thruster packs or small craft to cross over. While crossing, the attackers may be attacked with point defense weapons or by firing sand. Once across, boarding actions can be resolved using the personal combat rule s or the abstract boarding rules. Break Pursuit If a vessel is being pursued (as per the Pursuit action) the pilot or driver may break the pursuit with a successful opposed Pilot skill check against his opponent. Once the pursuit has broken and the pursui ng vessel loses all accumulated attack bonuses against that target. Calculate Jump Plot The navigator can hastily calculate a Jump Plot as a significant action in space combat. Normally an Easy (+4) Education -based Navigation skill check, hastening it to fit within one space combat turn imposes a DM -1 on the skill check. Dock with Another Vessel The pilot must make a successful Average(+0) Pilot check. If the other ship does not wish to be docked with then make opposed Pilot checks; the ship trying to doc k suffers a –2 DM. When docked, boarding actions can take place. Coordinate Crew The Captain makes an Average(+0) Leadership skill check. The Captain gains a pool of points equal to the Effect of the skill check (minimum of 1), which he can distribute to individual crew members as DMs (granting a +1 DM per point) on skill or ability checks during the combat turn.

Cepheus Engine SRD 153 Samardan Pre ss Electronic Warfare A sensors operator may attempt to jam radio communications and sensor locks by making an opposed Intelligence -based Comms che ck against the sensors operator of the opposing vessel. Electronic warfare can be used to break sensor locks. Alternatively, electronic warfare can be used to attack smart missiles that are targeting the ship. The sensors operator makes a Difficult ( –2) Co mms check and, if successful, a single attacking smart missile ceases attacking. The sensors operator may continue making checks to disable smart missiles until he fails one, with a cumulative –1 DM each time. Evasive Manuevers The pilot operates the vess el in an erratic manner in an attempt to avoid being hit by opposing weapons fire. The Pilot makes an Average(+0) Pilot skill. If successful, any attack rolls targeting the pilot's vessel suffer a DM -1 penalty, or DM -2 with an Exceptional Success. Increas e Initiative The Captain of a vessel may make a Leadership check and increase the Initiative of his vessel by the Effect of the check. This increase only applies for the following turn. Intercept Enemy Communications The sensors operator may attempt to in tercept enemy communications. This requires a Difficult( -2) Comms skill check. Encryption (if any) must also be broken. Knowledge of enemy intentions can be valuable to a Captain, if they know how to use it. The Captain may make an Easy (+4) Tactics check to gain an advantage from intercepted communications. If successful, the Captain gains knowledge of the enemy’s dispositions or intentions. This translates to a one -time DM+4 bonus to any skill check affecting the enemy (e.g. a pilot’s attempt to evade a s udden attack, or a gunner’s precise shot just as the enemy vessel turns to present a better target.) Of course, the enemy must have communications for them to be intercepted. Line Up the Shot A pilot may attempt to aid his gunners by providing a stable fi ring platform along an optimum attack vector. The pilot makes a Pilot check to aid his gunners, granting a DM+1 on all attacks rolls this turn with a success, or a DM+2 with an Exceptional Success. Maintain Communications The sensors operator can establis h and maintain communications between allied vessels with a Routine(+2) Comms skill check. If there is significant interference or a lot of communications going on (e.g. due to bad comm. discipline among a fleet), treat as Considerable Noise (DM -2). Delibe rate comms jamming requires an opposed Comms skill check with the jammer. If reliable communications are not established, vessels cannot act in concert, and Tactics skill cannot be applied. Pursuit If a pilot makes a successful opposed Pilot skill check against another vessel within Short or Close range travelling at the same speed as the pilot's vessel, the successful pilot has placed his vessel in pursuit of his target maintaining the current range and matching the target ship move for move. Once a purs uit has been established, it must be maintained each turn to take advantage of the position. Maintaining a pursuit is a significant action that does not require a skill check. It is automatically maintained unless the target succeeds at the Break Pursuit a ction, manages to extend the range between the vessels to Medium or greater, or succeeds in outpacing the speed of the pursuing vessel by 7+ points. For each turn (after the first) that a vessel maintains

Cepheus Engine SRD 154 Samardan Pre ss pursuit of another vessel, it gains a cumulative DM +1 to hit when attacking the vessel being pursued, up to a maximum of DM+4. Ram Ramming is a potentially suicidal maneuver in which a pilot intentionally crashes his vessel into the hull of another vessel. This action may only be attempted at Close range, and if the ramming vessel is moving faster than the target. To successfully ram another vessel requires an opposed Pilot skill check between both vessels. A collision inflicts 1D6 damage for every point of difference in speed between the two vessels. Ran ge Check The Navigator makes an opposed Navigation skill check with another vessel. The vessel with the highest result may elect to increase, decrease, or maintain the range between the vessels for the round. Reload Weapons System A crew member (usually t he gunner) may spend the round reloading one spent missile rack, one spent sandcaster or other individual weapon system. Repair Damaged System A character on damage control may attempt to repair a damaged system by making an Education -based Mechanics chec k. If the check is successful, determine how many hits are repaired: Table: Damage Repair Results Mechanics Check Effect Hits Repaired 0 1 1–5 2 6+ 3 A ship with repair drones and the Auto -Repair software also makes one or two repair checks on the ve ssel's turn (unless it is being used to assist other repair attempts). The standard Auto -Repair software makes the check with a +1 DM. These are battlefield repairs only and will break down as soon as the battle is over unless repaired properly. Sensor Ta rgeting The sensors operator may attempt to spend the turn providing improved fire control and targeting data to the gunners, hopefully increasing their chances of hitting their targets. The sensors operator should make a Education -based Comms skill check against the target's Sensor Jamming rating, for each vessel that is to targeted. If successful, all gunners on the vessel gain a DM+1 bonus to their attacks this turn, or a DM+2 on an Exceptional Success. When using missiles the initial attack gets this bo nus – the individual missile to hit rolls do not benefit directly. Smart missiles are unaffected. Miscellaneous A character may make a skill check or do something else as a significant action when such an action requires the character's full attention, c oncentration, complicated physical actions or some combination thereof. Any skill check with a time interval of 1 -6 minutes is simply considered a significant action during space combat.

Cepheus Engine SRD 155 Samardan Pre ss Reactions As in Personal Combat, reactions are actions taken imme diately in response to the action of another. A ship may react to incoming attacks. The following situations allow reactions: • Targeted by a beam attack • Incoming missile • Attempted boarding The ship's Initiative determines how many times it may react in a r ound. Table: Reactions By Initiative Initiative Reactions 0–4 1 5–8 2 9–12 3 13+ 4 Dodge Incoming Fire To dodge, the pilot must make a Pilot check. If successful, the attack suffers a –2 DM. Fire Sand Turrets equipped with sandcasters can fire sand at incoming beam attacks. Each reaction spent on firing sand allows the gunner to make a Turret Weapons roll. If successful the damage of each beam in the incoming attack is reduced by 1D6. Resolve each beam separately. Each firing of sand costs one canis ter of sand. Sand can also be directed against incoming boarding parties. If the sand attack is successful, each target in the boarding party takes 8D6 damage. Point Defense Turret lasers can be used to destroy incoming missiles. The missiles can only b e destroyed in the moments before they strike the spacecraft as they are too small and fast -moving to effectively target at greater ranges. The gunner must make a Turret Weapons check against the missile. If successful, the missile is destroyed. A gunner m ay keep making Turret Weapons checks against missiles until he misses an attack; each attack suffers a cumulative –1 penalty. Attacks may be directed against different incoming missiles. Point defense can also be used to attack incoming boarders in the sam e way. Trigger Screens Screens can be activated as long as the commander or one of the gunners has the Screens skill at Level 0 and the ship has the required screen type (nuclear against nuclear missiles and fusion guns; meson against meson guns). Scree ns reduce the damage from the attack by 2D6+the operator's Screens skill. Nuclear dampers also remove the automatic radiation hit from nuclear missile attacks.

Cepheus Engine SRD 157 Samardan Pre ss Table: Abstract Boarding Resolution Degree Attacker Wins Defender Wins Success Defender loses reactions this round; Attacker gains DM +2 on next opposed Tactics roll for boarding actions; The ship suffers one Single Hit of internal damage. Defender gains DM +2 on next opposed Tactics roll for boarding actions; The ship suffers one Single Hit of internal damage. Exceptional Success Attacker successfully boards ship (Defender crew may abandon ship, or are captured or killed at the discretion of the Attacker); Needs one turn to gain control of ship; Ship takes 2D6 damage of internal damage. Attacker is driven back to their own ship or out into space (or captured or killed at the discretion of the Defender, if Attacker’s forces are unable to retreat); If ships are still docked, Defender may elect to launch a boarding action against the former Attacker next turn. Missiles Unlike beam weapons, which travel at the speed of light and so hit the enemy vessel almost instantly, missile weapons take time to cross the gulf of space. Missiles travel at Thrust 10 to wards their designated target and their position can either be tracked as additional craft in the battle or, for the sake of simplicity, they can be assumed to strike after a number of turns dependent on launch range, as shown in the Missile Launch Range table. Missiles cannot be used at Adjacent or Close range. Table: Missile Launch Range Range Turns to Impact Adjacent - Close - Short 1 Medium 1 Long 1 Very Long 2 Distant 2 When the missile is launched, t he gunner must make a Turret Weapons or Ba y Weapons skill check to determine the accuracy of the launch. The effect of the skill check determines the chance that the missile will strike its target when it hits. A target may react to incoming missiles by dodging or point defense. This reaction does not take place until the turn the missiles arrive at their destination, so any target response must wait until then. Table: Missile To -Hit By Skill Check Effect Turret Weapons/Bay Weapons check Missile to -hit roll Failed With Effect –6 or less 11+ Failed With Effect –1 to –5 10+ Succeeded With Effect 0 8+ Succeeded With Effect 1 –5 7+ Succeeded With Effect 6+ 6+

Cepheus Engine SRD 158 Samardan Pre ss Smart Missiles The missile to -hit roll for smart missiles is always 8+ and if they miss they make another attack every turn until they are destroyed with point defense, jammed with ECM, run out of fuel or otherwise dissuaded. Planetary Maneuvers Within close range of a planet, certain planetary maneuvers become possible. Orbital Insertion: The pilot may attempt to insert the ship int o orbit around a planet. In an orbital insertion fails, the ship fails to enter the proper orbit, and the orbit will steadily begin to decay drawing the ship towards the planet’s atmosphere in an uncontrolled reentry (see Atmospheric Reentry below). This i s a significant action requiring a Routine(+2) Pilot skill check. Atmospheric Entry: The pilot may attempt to transition the ship out of orbit and into the atmosphere of a planet. This is a significant action with an Average (+0) Pilot skill check, with an y applicable DMs from the Atmospheric Entry table. Exotic, Corrosive, or Insidious atmospheres should be treated as Standard unless specified otherwise. Table: Atmospheric Entry World Values DM World Size 9+ -2 World Size 4 or less +2 World Atmosphere 1 or less Auto Success World Atmosphere 2 -5, 14(E) +2 World Atmosphere 8 -9, 13(D) -2 Special Weapon Rules Several types of weapons have their own rules. • Meson Guns: Meson guns ignore armor and always roll on the Internal Damage table. Furthermore, they also automatically inflict a radiation crew hit in addition to any other damage. • Fusion Guns: Fusion guns inflict a radiation crew hit in addition to any other damage. The bonus radiation hit suffers a –DM equal to the ship's armor. • Particle Beams: Parti cle beams inflict a radiation crew hit in addition to any other damage. The bonus radiation hit suffers a –DM equal to the ship's armor. • Nuclear Missiles: Nuclear missile hits inflict a radiation crew hit in addition to their normal damage. The bonus radia tion hit suffers a –DM equal to the ship's armor. • Sandcasters: While the primary purpose of a sandcaster is to block incoming beam attacks, they can also be used as an attack. A sandcaster has a range of Close and inflicts 1 point of damage. Damage System s can take a variable number of hits before being destroyed, depending on the system in question. A ship can endure one point of Hull damage per fifty tons, rounding down. A ship that runs out of Hull Damage will rapidly be incapacitated. A ship can endure one point of Structure damage per fifty tons, rounding down to a minimum of one. A ship that runs out of Structure breaks up and is completely destroyed. The effects of damage are determined by subtracting the ship's armor from the damage rolled by the we apon, then consulting the Space Combat Damage table to determine the number of hits inflicted. Then roll on the Space Combat Hit Location table for each hit. Small craft use the Small craft column. Vessels of 100 tons or larger use the External Hit (Vessel ) column until a ship has suffered enough damage to wipe out its Hull, and then uses the Internal Hit (Vessel) column. A double hit applies two hits to the same location. A triple hit applies three hits to the same location.

Weapons: When generating weapons, roll 2D6 and consult the Animal Weapons table. Add a +8 DM if the animal is a Carnivore, and a +4 if it is an Om nivore; subtract a –6 DM if the an imal is a Herbivore. Scavengers automatically have Teeth in addition to any other weapons. If a number is present after the Weapons type, then add that number to the number of damage dice the creature rolls. Damage from at tacks depends on the creature’s Strength score, as shown in the Damage by Strength table. Armor: When generating an animal’s armor, roll 2D6 -7, and add the animal’s Size result (the die roll result that determined the animal’s size, not the actual weight o f the animal.) Add a +4 DM when rolling for armor if the animal is a Herbivore, and a +2 if it is an Scavenger; apply a –2 DM if the animal is a Carnivore. Also, Flyers suffer a –2 DM when determining armor. Consult the Animal Armor table for the animal’s armor rating. Base Speed: An animal’s base speed is determined by generating a Speed Multiplier, as per the Animal Speed Multiplier by Subtype table, and multiplying that by 6, which is the average speed of a human in meters per

However, the system works best when the Referee prepares an encounter table for each ter rain likely to be encountered. This not only gives the Referee statistics for wilderness adventuring, but also provided a large amount of potential background data for expanding the world within the universe the Referee has created. To create an encounter table, first the Referee should select a table format. Although an encounter table can be in whatever format the Referee desires, the two formats most commonly used are represented in these rules as the 1 D6 Animal Encounter Table Template and the 2 D6 Anima l Encounter Table Template. Note that the Templates only provide an animal's type (carnivore, herbivore, omnivore or scavenger), and in the case of the 2D6 table, event. Each entry should be generated in turn. When an encounter table indicates that an even t will occur, the Referee should create an event appropriate to the world and terrain. An event may be almost anything, including a natural disaster or seismic event, an interesting terrain feature or curiosity, unusual flora or weather. The Hills Terrain Encounter Table is an example of a completed encounter table. 1D6 Animal Encounter Table Template 1D6 Animal Type 1 Scavenger 2 Herbivore 3 Herbivore 4 Herbivore 5 Omnivore 6 Carnivore

As a general rule, the Referee will check for an encounter once while the band is travelling and once while the band is halted (for rest, exercise, encampment, or whatever). There is a one -third chance (5+ on 1 D6) that an animal encounter will occur in any of the specified terrain types. The Referee may choose to modify this frequency depending on planetary or local conditions. In addition, specific encounters at specific locations are always possible. For example, the Referee may already have populated a location (perhaps a ruin) with specific animals. These are not subject to normal random encounter rules. By their lifeless nature, vacuum worlds (and any other world without life) tend to hav e encounter tables comprised primarily of events. On an airless world, events could include silt pools that operate like quicksand, magnetic anomalies, solar flares, or possibly tracks left by previous explorers. Animal Reactions in Encounters When charac ters disturb an animal or otherwise draw attention to themselves while within its territory roll 2D6 and consult the Animal Reactions by Subtype table. If the result on the table is neither attack nor flee, then the animal stands still until provoked again, in which case roll again. Table: Animal Reactions by Subtype

Cepheus Engine SRD 186 Samardan Pre ss CHAPTER 14: SOCIAL ENCOUNTERS In the Cepheus Engine, an encounter is defined a s an unexpected or casual meeting with someone or something. A large part of the Referee’s job is the administration of encounters. Through encounters, the Referee presents information, opportunities and conflicts for the players to interact with, which is the core of any gaming session. There are a number of different types of social encounters: routine, legal, patron, random, rumor and scenario. The Encounter Types Overview table offers suggestions on the frequency of various encounters, and the chance associated with the occurrence of such an encounter. Encounter Tables: This chapter provides a number of encounter tables to serve as inspiration for the Referee. The Referee is encouraged to create tables more in line with their Cepheus Engine universe or w ith the specific adventure they are running. Table: Encounter Types Overview Encounter Type Frequency Chance Routine As needed As needed Scenario As needed As needed Legal Daily Law Level or less on 2 D6 Random Daily 8+ on 2D6 Patron Weekly 9+ on 2D6 Rumor Weekly 7+ on 2 D6 Routine Encounters Routine encounters involve meeting normal people while doing normal activities, such as interviewing potential crew members in a starport diner or buying new ammunition from the clerk in a gun shop. Such scenes are rarely important in and of themselves. From a roleplaying perspective, routine encounters create a background of expected behavior that makes scenario encounters and random encounters stand out in comparison because of their unexpected content. Routine encounters help move characters logically from the time and place of one important scene to the next. Scenario Encounters Within the Cepheus Engine rules, an adventure is defined as a story for players to experience, comprised of a series of related scen es or encounters. These related encounters are called scenario encounters, because they serve to further the plot of the adventure toward its climax. The Referee creates scenario encounters as dictated by the story they will tell. Random Encounters Random encounters offer players a sense of variety in their gaming experience. These colorful encounters often include individuals pursuing goals that are unrelated to those of the adventurers themselves. From a roleplaying perspective, random encounters help create the illusion of a universe that exists outside of the adventurers' experiences, thus creating a sense of verisimilitude. Random encounters can be determined by rolling a D66 on a table such as the Random Encounters table presented in these rules. Uniq ue tables might be created for specific worlds or adventures. As with other social encounters, n on-player character reactions may be determined randomly by the Referee or selected according to the nature of the situation.

Cepheus Engine SRD 197 Samardan Pre ss Improvisation One of the keys to successfully running a Cepheus Engine session boils down to your ability to improvise when circumstances so dictate. You can cert ainly plan everything out for your session, to the degree with which you are comfortable. However, at some point in time, whether intentionally or accidentally, you are going to have to improvise a scenario that you did not plan in advance. Maybe the merce nary rolled poorly in that last combat, dying during the previous encounter, and the corporate executive that hired the adventurers only made the deal with him. Perhaps the party decides to pursue another adventure, which you had not yet prepared, half -way through the current one, based on a clue they found in the second encounter of the evening. Whatever the reason, you should be prepared as a Referee to improvise as needed to keep the session moving. A common misconception exists that improvisation during a game and preparation for a game are two opposed approaches. To the contrary, the more efficiently you prepare for the game, the easier it will be for you to improvise and “wing it” during actual play. The key to efficient preparation is not deciding ahe ad what the characters will do (leave that to the players), but rather creating material which would both allow the players to do exciting things and which will allow you to easily set up challenges, encounters, NPCs, locations and plots that will fit the flow of the game. This might sound like a lot of work at first but is actually much simpler, the key here is to create flexible material which will fit different plot lines, different locations and different uses with ease. In today’s world, spare time and inspiration tends to come at unexpected and irregular times. Carry a small notebook with you. Whenever an idea for whatever part of your game strikes your mind, jot it down in the notebook. Later on, when you happen to have a little more spare time, look these ideas and develop the ones you like a little bit more. Organize a binder at home (or a directory on your computer), with different partitions (or electronic files) for NPCs, locations, creatures, locations and plot hooks. Each item (NPC, location etc ) you develop shouldn't be long, a few sentences per item will work in most cases (remember that most stats for a character or creature will fit in a small paragraph, if not a single sentence.) Keep these well -organized and these could be used whenever you need them in -game or in a short -term preparation for the game. The same goes for location maps you happen to doodle during work, while riding public transit or while attending boring classes or lectures, nothing of this kind should go to waste. Most of th e adventure elements you prepare, even locations or NPCs intended to be used in a specific plot line, should be designed in such a way that it will be easy to 'recycle' these elements for use in different circumstances in the event you don’t use that eleme nt in the intended plot or location. Players have a tendency to miss the stuff you've labored hard to create, so be prepared to make a few changes to all the unused bits and pieces of previous adventures to use in the next ones. Improvisational Preparatio n It is definitely possible to prepare in advance for improvisation. It is suggested that Referees consider preparing the following for their adventure or campaign: A list of random names for NPCs, locations and vessels can serve any Referee well. Take the m from any source you like, your imagination, baby -name sites, even phone books, but it always helps to have a quick source of names for the people and places you have to create on the fly rather than just calling them “this guy” or “that tower”. That way, when the characters ask a random citizen for their name, you can easily choose one from your list, provide it to the group and then cross it off. Having the ability to name a character or place quickly helps establish a strong sense of depth and internal consistency within your setting. Many Referees also find it helpful to keep a small collection of generic locations and encounters on hand, in case the party decides to go in an unexpected direction. It is perfectly okay to use adventures or modules that you find online or in the products you own. If you can create a few easy -to-place encounters beforehand, this could also prove to be very useful. Your goal here is simply to have activities for the characters to do through the rest of the given gaming sessi on. You can always recoup and plot a better strategy for this new direction the players have taken between sessions. These little scenarios just give you a delaying tactic that lets you entertain your players at the same time.

Cepheus Engine SRD 198 Samardan Pre ss A collection of stat blocks for stock NPCs, perhaps expanding on the small collection found later in this guide, can provide you with potential allies, contacts, rivals, enemies, bystanders and potentially even ready -made player -characters should the need arise over the course of the gaming session. Creating a reference sheet of the player -characters’ important combat statistics can help you evaluate the impact of an encounter or challenge when you have to improvise a scenario on the fly. A notebook or electronic document for session n otes can help you capture the details you’ve created for your campaign or adventure, either on the fly or through early preparation. With this, you are more likely to provide a consistent and vibrant gaming experience. Recycling Game Material As preparati on time is limited for most Referees, you may find it of good benefit to maximize your effective use of material and rules while minimizing the time devoted to creating new non -player characters, vessels, adventures or locations from scratch. The nature of the Cepheus Engine is of great help here, as the rules are relatively simple and abstract; a major part of each animal, location, vessel or character is nothing but narrative, and narrative is easy to change. This is called “reskinning”. By changing the n arrative, the stat block for a veteran mercenary might be reused as an alien hunter with little or no modifications to the game mechanics. A good example is the use of location floor plans. If, for example, you've downloaded or bought detailed floor plans for a particular location (or a product including these floor plans) or perhaps you’ve found them online, you can utilize them in more than one way. If the floor plans originally detailed the hidden base of some human space pirates, you can still easily mo dify them to be used for an alien fortress, for the remnants of a research facility devastated by a natural disaster, or even for a private mansion for an eccentric corporate executive. The map can remain the same, or largely the same, but the description can change the perception of the players. Running the Game The first rule of the Cepheus Engine system is to have fun. A good Referee will make a reasonable effort to create a gaming experience that is fun for everyone. The following guidelines might he lp with that. Assigning Difficulties At the core of every Cepheus Engine adventure lies a sequence of tasks that the character must accomplish in order to succeed. The Referee is in charge of assigning the difficulty of these tasks, and then interpreting the outcome. The default is Average (+0). Make a task easier if you want a particular task to be accomplished, but not be everyone. This will highlight characters with skill levels in an easy way. If you want to make a task challenging, but still feel comf ortable with giving the players a good chance of success, set the Difficulty to Difficult ( -2). Reserve Very Difficult ( -4) and Formidable ( -6) for very special circumstances, such as attempting the near impossible. As the Referee, you may not want to say “No” except in the most extreme circumstances, but assigning a Difficulty of Formidable ( -6) is almost as good, and can create some interesting story developments and a sense of excited accomplishment should the character succeed. Modifying the Roll or th e Difficulty There are two ways of making a task easier or harder: modify the character's die roll or modify the task's Difficulty. Generally speaking, circumstances affecting a character's performance, like having just the right tools for the job or being forced to improvise, apply a modifier to the die roll. Circumstances making the task easier or harder to accomplish, like a favorable or unfavorable environment or a particularly demanding task, modify the Difficulty. If a condition applies to the charact er -- like knowledge, health, equipment, preparedness, and such -- it's usually a die modifier. It doesn't have to be too fine a line, since modifying the die roll or the Difficulty amounts to the same thing in the end: the task being easier or harder to a ccomplish.

Cepheus Engine SRD 199 Samardan Pre ss Circumstance Modifiers Some circumstances make a check easier or harder, resulting in a bonus or penalty that is added to the check result. The Referee can alter the odds of success in two ways: • If a character has help, such as good tools, c ompetent aids or other beneficial circumstances, he receives a +1 bonus to his skill check. • If a character is hampered, such as having defective tools, incompetent assistance or other negative circumstances, he receives a -1 penalty to his skill check. Automatic Successes Sometimes it is just easier to assume the character automatically succeeds at a skill check. If the character has an applicable skill, and the results of the skill check do not impact the progress of the story, endanger the character, a nd the actual success or failure is not interesting, just assume the character succeeds and move on. Remember, the Cepheus Engine rules suggest that the Referee should only call for checks: • When the characters are in danger. • When the task is especially dif ficult or hazardous. • When the characters are under the pressure of time. • When success or failure is especially important or interesting. Using Opposed Checks Opposed checks are a great way to create tension between two individuals. Suddenly, the players can target their attention on an NPC, and that helps with immersion into the game. Should two or more characters seek to do the same thing at the same time, or to resist one another’s actions, use an opposed check. The highest check result wins. That’s not in the Rules Sometimes in the course of play, things come up that are not covered in the rules. When this happens, t he Referee is responsible for these handling situations, making fair evaluations of what the characters do and deciding what happens as a result. As the Referee, you will need to quickly improvise a solution. The easiest way to do so is to simply decide if the suggested action is fun or not, and if it is fun, let it happen, then throw in a complication that adds to the enjoyment of the scen e. Some Referees prefer a more mechanical approach. Identify a skill the covers the basic nature of the request, set a Difficulty of Average (+0) or Difficult ( -2), and let them try. If nothing comes to mind immediately, ask the player to tell you what ski ll they would use to accomplish this task. If no skill appears to work, then choose the best characteristic, and have the player roll a characteristic check. However you decide to resolve it, the key here is to quickly address the request and keep the game moving forward. Solo Play as Referee Prep Work Many of the Cepheus Engines rule subsystems can be leveraged for solo play. For Referees, this can turn building a universe of their own into a game in and of itself. What follows is a list of suggested acti vities that can prove to be fun in and of themselves, as well as help Referees create new material for their personal adventures and campaigns. In addition, solo play can help Referees learn the rules and become more proficient for when they run games befo re a group of players. Solo play is not limited to Referees. Players can also learn a lot about and enjoy aspects of the Cepheus Engine rules through solo play in those times when a Referee or gaming group is not currently available.

Cepheus Engine SRD 201 Samardan Pre ss CHAPTER 17: ADVENTURES Players in a Cepheus Engine universe are adventurers, plain and simple. They will seek out experiences and exploits, reveling in the thrill and excitement tha t comes from the pursuit of their goals. Cepheus Engine adventures encompass the potential for adventure that can be found in classic era science fiction. The opportunities are virtually limitless, restricted only by the circumstances of the scenario and t he capabilities of the characters. The Referee generates and adjudicates encounters that make up the building blocks of these adventures. As the characters move from one adventure to the next, the stories create a campaign, set against a universe of the Re feree's creation. Therein lays the core of a great roleplaying game experience. Conflict Stories are about conflict. Conflict doesn’t have to be violent, but without a struggle of some kind, there is no story, and without a story, there is no true sense o f adventure. The key to a great adventure is conflict. As a Referee, you should make sure you have conflict, and that the player characters are directly involved in that conflict. If there isn't any conflict, you lose the impetus for action. If the player characters aren't directly involved, they are just watching a story, which sounds more like a movie or a play than a roleplaying game. Conflict doesn’t have to be physical combat. It could just as easily be political or corporate intrigue, achieving a spec ific goal before the protagonist can either get there first or stop the characters from succeeding, handling courtly issues of a noble or legal nature, negotiating a diplomatic resolution to a larger conflict, and much more. The Plot The plot of the adve nture is essentially the synopsis of the events that will transpire over the course of the adventure. You should be able to sum up the plot of your adventure in one sentence. Knowing your plot before you begin creating the adventure provides focus and dire ction, and creates context for the scenes you will create for your adventure. If you have problems in coming up with a plot for your adventure, you might look into Polti’s “The Thirty -Six Dramatic Situations.” It’s an extensive list of basic plots that you can use as the basis for your own stories and adventures. The EPIC Adventure System The Epic Adventure System provides a way to design and organize adventures, that incorporates enough flexibility that the player characters have the 'freedom to roam' wit hout causing the Referee nightmares. An Epic Adventure is broken down into 6 parts: • Cast of Characters • Background • Minor Scenes • Plot Keys • Chapters • Adventure Checklist The Cast of Characters The Cast of Characters describes the major characters encountered in the course of the adventure. The Background The Background section provides the Referee with the background information necessary to properly run the adventure, and lays the groundwork for introducing this adventure to the players.

Cepheus Engine SRD 202 Samardan Pre ss Minor Scenes Mino r Scenes (usually just referred to as 'Scenes') or just Scenes, are encounters or events that involve the player characters in some form. Many are directly related to the adventure, and may provide clues, equipment, or other information and materials neede d to eventually complete the adventure. Others are merely to provide diversion and amusement. Scenes, unless noted in their descriptions, do not need to be played in any particular order, and may be sprung upon the player characters when the Referee deems appropriate. Plot Keys Plot Keys (or simply 'Keys') make up the heart of the storyline for the adventure. They contain vital pieces to the plot that must be played for the adventure to make any sense to the players in the end. You may play any number of S cenes before and after each Plot Keys, but all of the Plot Keys should eventually be completed in their proper order. Chapters A Chapter (or 'Act') is made up of one of more Plot Keys, and probably one or more Scenes. They outline the plot to the Referee, and provide tips and information for playing the Scenes and Plot Keys that are contained in the Chapter. In order to complete a Chapter, each Plot Key within must be completed. Each Chapter must be completed, and played in order to successfully run the ad venture. Because of the 'cinematic' nature of an EPIC adventure, it is easy for the Referee to allow the player characters to temporarily deviate from the current adventure storyline to follow a false lead or pursue another short adventure that has interes ted them. When the player characters are ready to return to this adventure plot line, simply pick up with the next Scene. Adventure Checklist The Adventure Checklist provides the Referees with a recommended guideline of the order in which various Scenes a nd Plot Keys in this adventure should be presented to the players. As the characters complete each Scene or Plot Key, the Referee simply checks it off the list. When every Plot Key in a Chapter has been played, that Chapter has been completed and the Refer ee may begin the first Scene in the next Chapter. You will note that not every Minor Scene is included in the Checklist. This allows Referees who would like to use the Checklist, but would like to change things a little bit to swap out scenes, or include t heir own custom scenes. If you feel comfortable in letting your characters stray from the order of the Checklist, you may determine the 'cinematic' order of the scenes as you see fit, or use a weekly events chart like the Example Weekly Event table to dete rmine the course of events. This example weekly events chart has been created for an adventure in which the characters spend several weeks in the outback searching for lost ruins in the hope of finding historical artifacts. Table: Example Weekly Event 2D6 Weekly Event 2-8 Play a Minor Scene/Find a Ruin 9-11 Starport Run. The Professor has an errand requiring the characters to go to the local starport for the week. 12 Plot Key Explanation of Example Weekly Event entries: Play a Minor Scene: Select one of the Minor Scenes and run the scene as directed. Starport Run: This is an excuse and opportunity to bring in sideline encounters, patrons and scenarios unrelated to this adventure.

Cepheus Engine SRD 203 Samardan Pre ss Play a Plot Key: Plot Keys should be plays in the correct order for the a dventure to make sense to the players. If you change the order of the Plot Keys, you should be sure to adjust the other scenes to ensure that the adventure flows properly and makes sense. Adventures in Five Acts Many satisfying adventures have been inspir ed by the five -act structure of literary and dramatic creations. Made famous by Gustav Freytag’s analysis of Shakespearean plays, the five -act structure lends itself well to basic adventures with only minor modifications. At its core, the five -act structur e for adventures depends on five major scenes or Plot Keys: the Story Hook and Challenge, the Escalation, the Complication, the Climax and finally the Reward. Even though this structure is based on five Plot Keys, you can easily add or subtract as many minor scenes as the adventure you’re creating calls for. Don’t be afraid to deviate from this pattern as you become more comfortable with adventure creation. The Story Hook The key to the opening scene of any adventure is action. The story hook Plot Key shou ld therefore be an action scene, involving either combat or some form of physical challenge. This draws the characters into the main conflict of the adventure’s plot, and introduces the party to agents of the main antagonist. As this scene is wrapping up, you can either provide clues to the direction of the next Plot Key, or introduce a minor scene that ultimately points the party in the direction of the final climax of the adventure. The Escalation Now that you’ve met the needs of your more action -oriente d players, you should create a series of roleplaying scenes or puzzle challenges that further escalate the plot, leading ultimately to a Plot Key that helps the players form a plan of attack for reaching the climax of the adventure. This allows non -combat characters an opportunity to shine. Investigation and information gathering make for excellent scenes in this regard. In addition, it provides the full roleplaying experience to the players, emphasizing why the group is playing a roleplaying game instead o f a board game. The Complication Nothing is ever as straight -forward as it seems. The third major Plot Key introduces a complication to the party in fulfilling the needs of the plot. This Plot Key often requires the characters to expend resources, forcin g them to decide on whether to spend their resources on this particular challenge or the big climactic challenge that is coming up next. In addition, this scene often introduces a plot twist or restriction that makes the resolution of this challenge and/or the climax that much harder. The Climax This Plot Key is the final showdown, the final fight with the primary antagonist of this story and his minions. This scene is most often a big fight or confrontation, but under the right circumstances, it could be a social or mental challenge instead. This is the big scene where everyone should have a chance to shine. It is suggested that this scene require a challenge more complex than “kill everyone”, even if it’s as simple as “kill everyone without any collateral damage to property or other persons”. If the climax is a combat scene, the site for the climax should also include at least two different terrain features, to provide for some interesting situations that make such scenes memorable. While you don’t want to overdo yourself, you also want to make this scene feel more exciting or important than the other scenes in the adventure.

Cepheus Engine SRD 204 Samardan Pre ss The Reward This scene is the dénouement, where the plot is wrapped up and the characters receive their reward for their victory, o r experience the consequences of their failure, on those occasions where things didn’t necessarily work out. Often in Cepheus Engine adventures, the reward is monetary. However, characters might instead earn titles, receive ship shares, gain political supp ort, earn some form of social advantage, recover lost or hidden information, or even learn a campaign secret that could change the face of the world forever. Sometimes, there’s a final plot twist here, such as a secret guardian guarding the reward or a fal se reward serving as a distraction from the true reward of the adventure. If you have ideas for a future scenario you’d like to offer the players, you can even drop the first hints of things to come in the reward scene, giving the characters motivation to pursue the clues that may well lead to their next daring adventure. Other Suggestions When creating your own adventures, keep things dense and concise. You will find that players have a knack for complicating things all by themselves, so don't feel a need to include a lot of false leads and irrelevant details. You can always improvise the additional of extra scenes as the need arises, but it is hard to work around a large number of required scenes if the adventurers suddenly take the adventure in a totally different direction. The Three -Dimensional Campaign Unless you're running a “one -shot” adventure, put in the effort to keep your setting, plot and adventure three - dimensional. That is, even if your campaign has a very strong overarching plot, not everyth ing has to be tied in it directly. For example, if your campaign revolves around a massive struggle between two interstellar polities, there should be some NPCs, sub -plots, protagonists and even organizations that don't work directly (if at all) for any si de of the overarching conflict. Not every protagonist in your game has to serve the enemy government, and not all good guys have to get along together very well. The reason for this, besides realism, is that both you and your players will eventually want t o take a break from the main plot and do something else, especially during a long campaign. Sometimes you'll want, say, to steal a high -tech prototype, and that research facility belongs to a third interstellar government that remains outside the overarchi ng conflict; sometimes you'll just want to explore an old, forgotten ruin uncovered in the wilderness of a backwater planet, a place unrelated to the main plot. Besides, making two factions work together against a common enemy despite hating each other wit h a passion could be a cool adventure, and so could be playing one opposing faction against another without getting caught. The Rule of Three As a general rule of a thumb when creating background elements involved in conflicts, such as organizations, factions, political figures, etc., you will best be served by creating three of them. For example, when you're designing a power struggle in an interstellar government, you should probably have three factions. The typical war can be created with three opposing sides, even if one of them is simply a large band of pirates with goals at odds with the two “official” sides. Creating three elements vying for the same goal creates a greater degree of dynamic complexity, allowing for adventures that explore the differe nt relationships between the three elements without reducing the conflict to a simple “black -and-white”, two -dimensional confrontation. Three sides give you plenty of opportunity to explore shifting alliances, subversive practices, negotiations, alternate paths to personal success and greater variety in your scenarios.
