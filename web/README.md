   npm install -g http-server
   ```
3. Navigate to the web directory:
   ```bash
   cd web
   ```
4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   http-server -p 8080
   ```
5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`

### Option 2: Python HTTP Server

1. Navigate to the web directory:
   ```bash
   cd web
   ```
2. Start Python's built-in server:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8080
   ```
3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`

### Option 3: Direct File Opening

You can also open `index.html` directly in your browser, but some features may be limited due to CORS restrictions.

## File Structure

## Game Tips

1. **Regular Maintenance**: Keep your ship in good condition to avoid breakdowns
2. **Crew Morale**: High morale improves performance and reduces negative events
3. **Resource Management**: Balance credits between maintenance, crew salaries, and trading
4. **Event Choices**: Consider the long-term consequences of your decisions
5. **Save Often**: Use the save button to preserve your progress

## Development

### Adding New Events

To add new events, modify the `loadEventDefinitions()` method in `event-manager.js`:

```javascript
'new_event_type': {
    title: 'Event Title',
    description: 'Event description...',
    choices: [
        {
            text: 'Choice text',
            action: () => {
                // Action logic
                return 'Result message';
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Adding New Ship Systems

To add new ship systems, modify the `systems` object in the `Ship` constructor in `ship.js`.
